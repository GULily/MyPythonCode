BIOS E-157 Viruses and Immunity: A Molecular Arms Race|Jamie Schafer|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/viruses-immunity-molecular-arms-race/14263|In order to replicate and propagate, viruses must contend with an onslaught of immune responses at both the intracellular and organismal level. Evolutionarily, this leads to an arms race between viruses and the immune system, as each evolves mechanisms to overcome the other. This course provides an introduction to several viruses that cause human disease and the immune responses that they evade or succumb to. The course is organized in two sections: first, introduction of the immune responses most relevant for viral infection (including antibodies, T cells, natural killer cells, and intracellular nucleic acid sensors); and second, discussion of viruses famous for their impact on society and human health (including HIV, Ebola, and herpesviruses, among others). Each virus is explored in the context of its replication, mechanisms of transmission, and interaction with the immune system. We conclude with presentations led by graduate-credit students, which may extend to viruses beyond those previously examined in the course and to specialized topics, such as applications of viruses in biotechnology and therapeutics. Graduate students also participate in discussions of primary scientific literature related to lecture topics throughout the course. Because molecular virology, immunology, and interactive learning are core components of the course, students should come prepared with confident mastery of introductory cell and molecular biology, and willingness to participate in critical thinking activities that involve discussing their ideas with their peers.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|14263

BIOS E-210 Neurobiology of Circadian Rhythms: Regulation of Physiological Systems and Involvement in Disease States|Sabina Berretta|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/neurobiology-circadian-rhythms-regulation-physiological-systems-involvement|Circadian rhythms are involved in essential biological processes driving our daily physiology and behavior. They have recently come to the forefront of neurobiological investigations as a key system regulating not only autonomic functions, but also complex brain circuitry processing emotion and cognitive information. Initially thought to arise from a neural circuit fully controlled by the hypothalamus, they are now better understood to involve a complex regulation of clock genes in virtually all cells in the brain, including in a multitude of cortical and subcortical brain regions that participate in fear, stress response, reward processing and, more in general, plasticity and learning. Emerging evidence consistent with these functions supports a key role for a disruption of circadian rhythms in several brain disorders. In addition, circadian rhythms play key roles in regulating functions of several body organs and systems, such as the liver, lungs, and respiratory, immune, and circulatory systems. Recent advances in the understanding of neural circuits and molecular pathways involved in regulating circadian rhythms have broadened our understanding of their role in normal and disease states. This seminar examines the neurobiology of circadian rhythms in mammals. Emphasis is placed on the involvement of circadian rhythms in normal biological functions, such as feeding behavior, energy metabolism, and learning and memory, as well as in disease conditions including cancer, obesity, stress, and mood disorders.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|15073
BIOS E-232 Neurobiology of Emotion and Psychiatric Illnesses|Sabina Berretta|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/neurobiology-emotion-psychiatric-illnesses/23451|Investigations on the neural basis of emotion and pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders synergistically inform each other, and in recent years have led to a leap in our understanding of emotion processing in normal and pathological conditions. In this course, a working definition of emotion from a biological point of view serves as background to explore brain circuits involved in aspects of emotional processing and their integration with decision making and goal-directed behavior. Neural networks linking the cingulate gyrus, insula, and ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortices, hippocampus and subcortical regions such as the amygdala, 'limbic' thalamus, and ventral striatum are discussed in light of their relevance to emotion processing and psychiatric disorders. Emerging concepts are the key role of biological value in emotion processing and the relationship between emotion and memory. Within this context, we discuss current knowledge on the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, with particular emphasis on clinical domains such as anxiety, psychosis, depression, autism spectrum disorders, and antisocial personality disorder. Finally, current knowledge on the neurobiology of emotion and psychiatric disorders is placed in the context of social interactions, focusing in particular on the intersection between justice and psychiatry.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|23451
BIOS E-240 Biochemical and Physiological Adaptation of Microbes|Alain Viel|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/biochemical-physiological-adaptation-microbes/23825|Microbes have developed molecular mechanisms—morphological and anatomical features that allow them to survive in a wide range of habitats.

Why just one—why not 200? Or an infinite number? What if we could see the story in every human moment—and tell it with passion? This workshop focuses on story origins. We spend part of the semester learning new techniques to get stories started and new ways of looking at the very nature of storytelling. We read what different authors have to say about where stories come from, and what different journals seem to look for in stories. We consider a great volume of published fiction to see what makes a plot or character compelling. In the last six weeks of the term, we finish some of the stories we have started, and work on polishing them into completed, publishable works.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|14251
CREA E-24 Story Development|Shelley Evans|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/story-development/24510|This workshop introduces the unique challenges of longform storytelling, and helps writers develop strategies for approaching long projects, either screenplays or novels. Many writers are drawn to the page by character or language or theme, but story is the scaffold on which movies and novels depend. Over the course of the semester, we learn to work creatively with the tasks of story building. We begin with ideas—where and how do we find them? What kinds of ideas can carry a story? How can you turn a wobbly idea into one that works? We then consider character—who does the story belong to? How do their desires, problems, and drives give the story its essential energy? Then we turn to story development and structure, the primary work of the course: how do you keep an idea alive for two-hundred pages, or two hours? What elements help a story build energy and momentum, and deliver us to a satisfying close? We explore these essential story energies using writing exercises, examples from film and literature, and the shared experience of working writers.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24510

CREA E-30 Introduction to Writing Poetry|David Barber|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-writing-poetry/24737|Is poetry the art of creating "imaginary gardens with real toads in them," as Marianne Moore put it, or "the synthesis of hyacinths and biscuits," as it was for Carl Sandburg? Does poetry make you "feel physically as if the top of [your] head were taken off," like it did for Emily Dickinson, or does it give you a glimpse of "a pheasant disappearing in the brush," as was the case for Wallace Stevens? This course explores answers to these and other questions of poetics through the intensive writing and the close reading of poems. In a friendly and constructive workshop environment, we investigate how the eye, the ear, and the mind work in concert to produce poems. In-class writing assignments alternate with the discussion of essays about writing and the analysis of published poems. Students present their own work in class for the honest, supportive critique of their peers. We experiment with a variety of poetic forms, from the sonnet to the villanelle to free verse.

CSCI E-34 User Experience Engineering|David S. Platt|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/user-experience-engineering/14557|Success in today's software marketplace requires an excellent user experience (UX). That's why all developers, architects, and managers today need to understand the basic principles of UX, even if it's not their primary job. In this course, we take an in-depth look at the foundations of an excellent UX in a platform-agnostic manner. We learn to ask and then answer the vital questions that everyone involved in software needs to consider when making every design decision; we learn to start with the user, not the toolkit. Who are our users and how do we represent them? What problems are these particular users trying to solve, and what would they consider the characteristics of a good solution? How should the user interaction flow, and how can we represent that with stories? How can we prototype and test different designs? How can we create programs to learn what users really do, instead of what they can remember doing or are willing to admit to doing? How can we measure how well we've succeeded? Rather than getting into the implementation of such elements, we focus on how one decides what to implement, and why, in order to make the user happier and more productive. For example, the web and other channels contain an enormous amount of information about how to program a color gradient or an animation. There is almost zero discussion anywhere about when to use a color gradient or animation and when not to, or why you should use them in this situation but not in that one. This course aims to correct that imbalance. Useful design tools, such as the Balsamiq mock-up editor, are discussed as they bear on specific covered topics. Tools aimed primarily at user experience implementation, such as Microsoft Expression Blend, are not covered.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|14557

CSCI E-43 How to Assess and Communicate Risk in Information Security|Derek Brink|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/how-assess-communicate-risk-information-security/24587|In simple terms, risk is the likelihood of something bad taking place, and the resulting business impact if it does occur. We often talk about the bad things that could happen—the threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits, and the technologies that are used to defend against them—but these are not risks. Business decision makers need their subject-matter experts in information security to advise them not about the technical details, but about how likely is it for that something bad to occur, about the business impact if it does occur, and about how an investment in given security controls quantifiably reduces that risk. This course covers how to assess security risks, properly defined, how to use these risk assessments to make recommendations for what to do about them, and how to communicate these risks effectively to business decision makers.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24587

CSCI E-58 Bioinformatics Algorithms|Jeff Parker|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/bioinformatics-algorithms/24039|Living things encode their genetic code in DNA, and use this information to regulate life processes. Bioinformatics is the study of living organisms viewed as information processors. We study algorithms for problems such as gene finding, sequence alignment, motif finding, construction of phylogenetic trees, and structure prediction. While students can find implementations of many of these algorithms, a study of the algorithms leads to a better understanding of the assumptions and limitations of existing algorithms, and gives students the background to evaluate new ones. We explore some important biological problems, discuss mathematical models, and look at computer algorithms to solve these problems. Most of the interesting problems are intractable, so we look at heuristics.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24039

CSCI E-86 Building the Brain: A Survey of Artificial Intelligence|Gabriele Fariello|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/building-brain-survey-artificial-intelligence/24827|What will our artificial intelligence (AI) overlords look like? The world is abuzz with deep learning, machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. There are countless videos with artificial neural networks depicted as simple circles interconnected with lines or tutorials that are long on the mathematical concepts; however, the truth is a bit more complicated. If you want to know enough to write a neural network, you find precious little out there. If you want to model real neurons, neural networks fall short. In this course we explore the true physical neuron found in nature and in our heads, how it works, how it can be modelled in a very limited way, and how the nodes in artificial neural networks are very different from these. We explore why AI is suddenly hot again, after thirty years in hibernation. We learn how to create an artificial neural network and see inside the black box of libraries that do this automagically for us. We explore some of the ethical, political, and socio-economic ramifications and questions highlighted by advances in these fields. There is much work that can still be done to help enhance these networks to better approximate natural networks of neurons, and how it may be possible to meld different versions of networks and more traditional programmatic control (as is being used in autonomous vehicles) to create far more complex emergent systems behavior. This course is not intended to replace other artificial intelligence courses but is intended to be a survey course of sufficient depth to allow you to better understand the technology, its potential benefits and pitfalls, and to be able to speak intelligently about the subject matter.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24827

CSCI E-265 Big Data Systems|Stratos Idreos|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/big-data-systems/24598|Big data is everywhere. A fundamental goal across numerous modern businesses and sciences is to be able to exploit as many machines as possible, to consume as much information as possible and as fast as possible. The big challenge is how to turn data into useful knowledge. This is far from a simple task and also a moving target as both the underlying hardware and our ability to collect data evolve. In this course, we discuss how to design data systems and algorithms that can scale up and scale out. Scale up refers to the ability to use a single machine to all its potential, to exploit properly the memory hierarchy and the multiple CPU and GPU cores of modern hardware. Scale out refers to the ability to use more than one machine (typically hundreds or thousands) effectively. This is a research-oriented course. Every week we read two modern research papers; one from the scale up area and one from the scale out area. We use examples from several areas, including relational systems and distributed databases, graph processing systems (for social networks), key-value stores, noSQL and newSQL systems, as well as mobile computing. Each student works on two systems projects and (optionally) on a semester-long data systems research project which can be in any of the above areas and based on an open research question.

DGMD E-23 Planning Successful Websites and Applications|Jennifer A. Kramer|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/planning-successful-websites-applications/24594|With all the coding courses available online, it's not hard to learn the technical tools and languages needed to build a website or application. However, what is less clear is how to go about the process—what information belongs in the product, for whom does the product exist, and how should the product be organized are just a few of the questions that still need to be answered before coding can begin. In this course, students learn to plan and design a website or application, including choosing a target audience, defining site goals and reconciling these with user and business goals, establishing a brand and a tone of voice, and designing a page architecture. By the end of the course, students are able to plan and design a website or application, so when they are ready to code, they have a clear specification for the final product. This course is not a coding course—it focuses on the other aspects of web and application creation.|January session|On campus only|24594

This course explores the strong tradition short films have in our culture, as well as the new and innovative techniques filmmakers are currently using to tell and distribute their stories. In this course, students devote the entire semester to the creation and completion of one short film, narrative or documentary, with the intent of festival submission and/or online release. Students work in a collaborative atmosphere with classmates and the instructor to refine scripts and treatments, plan productions, and create the final film. Students may work individually or partner in a collaborative team. Either way, the class serves as a support system for each student, offering advice, critiques, and resources so that each member of the class is an integral part of a fully-realized short. In addition to supporting traditional filmmaking approaches, innovative storytelling techniques are strongly welcomed and supported. These can include interactive online documentaries, hybrid approaches (blending fiction and nonfiction), webisode pilots, and experimental techniques.

DGMD E-60 Applied Online Course Design|Adrienne Phelps-Coco|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/applied-online-course-design/24538|In this class, we approach online course design as a creative endeavor that's grounded in learning theory and bounded by the practical realities of everyday course development. We read as practitioners, asking ourselves how various ideas might apply (or not apply) to designs we create and seeking inspiration in a wide variety of places. To help us envision the scope of design possibilities and to prepare for an unknowable future of online learning, we practice brainstorming multiple solutions to common design challenges. Over the course of the semester, you create an online learning project of your choice, which we collectively workshop and learn from. You walk away with a project you can actually use or can showcase to potential employers. Among the topics we address are working with instructors/subject matter experts to identify and design to the heart of a course, enhancing student community, translation of face-to-face experiences, selecting online technologies, assignment and assessment design, reusability, gamification, and evaluation of learning design success.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24538

It is important to remember that Shakespeare's verse dramas were written to be performed and that only when they are approached this way—as playable, theatrical texts—do they have their maximum impact. Through text analysis, scene study, vocal work, and acting exercises we attempt to find, not only the meaning, but the music and theatrical power of Shakespeare's words. We spend a great deal of class time discussing blank verse and the different techniques for speaking it out loud and work to develop the end-of-line breath support needed to perform this language. We also study such topics as scansion, phrasing, word emphasis, antithesis, and imagery.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24418

ECON E-1005 Foundations of Real-World Economics|John Komlos|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/foundations-real-world-economics/14599|The course discusses complex economic processes in relatively simple terms so that they can be understood without the use of mathematics. The focus is on real-world applications of economics rather than the academic mainstream's blackboard economics, which relies on theoretical reasoning and abstract models of the economy. We apply the concepts we learn to contemporary controversial topics such as minimum wage legislation, the function of unions, and why the free market overcharges for health care. We explore why the current economy is—using Paul Krugman's words—in a low-level depression and is drifting rudderless. Krugman has also referred to it as a sour economy because it is unable to provide a sweet life for so many millions of its citizens. Blackboard economists do not have the answers because they are unable to think creatively about new institutional structures to transition to a full-employment, high-wellbeing economy. In contrast, in this course we incorporate ideas from psychology, sociology, and political science into our discussions in order to explore these issues. We also discuss ways to restructure the economy in order to extricate ourselves from the mess left over by the bailouts of the big banks. The course includes concepts from both microeconomics and macroeconomics.|Fall Term 2016|Online (live) web conference|14599

What if having access to informal financial services in your community greatly improved your ability to generate a more livable income? Microfinance is a powerful tool in the anti-poverty toolkit to help people in challenging economic conditions have a more prosperous life. In this course, we address how small improvements can be made and take a comprehensive look at microfinance and its impact on people and societies. After forming a solid understanding of the various solutions offered under the microfinance umbrella (credit, savings, insurance), we examine opportunities for domestic and international microfinance initiatives. Students actively participate in the microfinance experience by lending to an actual business owner of their choice, analyzing real-time case studies from around the globe, and interacting with Boston-area microfinance professionals and beneficiaries. Additionally, in partnership with the non-profit Human Connections, the instructor leads an optional experiential learning trip to Mexico or Latin America to complement the classroom curriculum and bring you closer to the realities of microfinance.

The world is attracted to their promise of booming markets, massive potential for local consumer markets, abundant low-cost labor, and rising middle class. These make emerging economies key players in international trade and business, although upon closer examination we find the landscape is fraught with an ongoing slowdown across the world's major emerging markets and complex economic and financial systemic risks. Special emphasis is put on the emerging markets' economics, finance, banking, and their economic relations with the rest of the world, as well as the causal factors and limits of economic policy in the entire post-Soviet region, Eurasia, China, India, and Southeast Asia.|Spring Term 2017|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|24054

ECON E-1533 Monetary Policy After the Financial Crisis|Dorian Klein|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/monetary-policy-after-financial-crisis/24787|This course closely examines the path of public policy, whether fiscal stimulus plans or the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, through the nuts and bolts of—and from the viewpoint of—the capital markets. When the Fed or the European Central Bank announces a monthly $85 billion securities buying program, how exactly does this money flow through the markets? When the government bails out a major bank, how does this action affect the bank, its competitors, the markets, future perceptions, the economy at large? How can central banks affect the economy in an environment of zero and even negative interest rates? Should regulation influence the behavior of firms or individuals? Using the 2008 financial crisis and policy responses thereto as a backdrop, we explore how (and whether) the new capital markets created over the past thirty years as a result of greatly increased financial innovation, globalization, and communication are distorting the economic effect of traditional government monetary and/or fiscal influence. The role of important constituents (commercial and investment banks, exchanges, regulators, hedge funds, government interventions) are reviewed and evaluated for both past performance and future relevance. The course addresses important current topics in both economics and public policy, such as too big to fail, moral hazard, globalization of markets, currency unions, liquidity traps, efficiency of markets, the role of credit rating agencies, shadow banking, regulation of derivatives and hedge funds, Glass-Steagall, and the Volcker Rule.|Spring Term 2017|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|24787

ECON E-1625 Economic Strategy and Competitiveness|Mark Esposito|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/economic-strategy-competitiveness/24481|With the developments of the world economy becoming ever more unpredictable, there is not only a need for executives to have a good idea what is happening around us right now—they need to also think about how the future could unfold, strategically. Even though this course is by no account claiming to be a crystal ball, it seeks to help executives and professionals gain a clearer understanding of the latest economic, social, and technological affairs happening around us. It is intended to build economic strategic thinking, grounded on competitiveness studies and social progress.|Spring Term 2017|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|24481
ECON E-1700 Urban Development Policy|James Carras|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/urban-development-policy/15079|This course reviews development policy making in urban areas, focusing on differing economic, demographic, institutional, and political settings. Course topics include a critical analysis of the continuing viability of cities in the context of current economic and demographic dynamics, fiscal stress, governance, economic development, poverty and race, drugs, homelessness, federal urban policy, and survival strategies for declining cities. The course considers economic development, social equity, and job growth in the context of metropolitan regions, and addresses federal, state, and local government strategies for expanding community economic development and affordable housing opportunities. Of special concern is the continuing spatial and racial isolation and concentration of low-income populations, especially minority populations, residing in urban communities including older, industrial cities. The course examines how market forces and pressures affect the availability of affordable housing, exacerbate the impacts of gentrification, and inhibit the availability of capital for affordable housing and economic development. It also examines how issues around growing housing affordability problems, the changing structure of capital markets, the reduction of low-skilled jobs in central city locations, and racial discrimination combine to limit housing and employment opportunities.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|15079
ECON E-1815 The Uber Economy: How Technology Is (and Is not) Changing the Boundaries of the Firm|Jane P. Katz|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/uber-economy-how-technology-not-changing-boundaries-firm/24707|Some call it the share economy, others the gig economy; still others prefer the freelance or access economy. In this course, we explore the impact new technology is having on how firms connect to their customers, how they compete with incumbent and new firms in their product market, and what this means for workers and outcomes in labor markets. How many workers and firms are affected? Are there limits to what types/how many workers and firms are likely to be affected? What can we learn from Hollywood? We look at previous historical examples of this type of organization—including the movie and TV industry which has long had a disaggregated approach to producing its product and hiring workers. We examine Uber, AirBnb, and similar firms. How was their rise facilitated by new technology? What do they provide their customer that was not previously available? How is this changing competition?  What is the nature of this new employment relationship with workers? Are the employees independent contractors, or something in between? To what extent does this affect labor market outcomes including flexibility and worker autonomy, but also worker income, non-wage benefits such as health insurance, and income security? To what extent do these new relationships—between customer and firm and between firm and worker—require new types of government oversight or regulation (if any)?|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24707
ECON E-1825A The Minimum Wage Debate|Jane P. Katz|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/minimum-wage-debate/24424|This course explores the debate about the minimum wage from all points of view. What is the history of the minimum wage in the US? Who is affected? Does the minimum wage reduce employment of low wage workers, as some argue? Does it have a significant impact on their incomes? Should the federal government raise the minimum wage? Abolish it? Leave it to the states? Why do some firms pay entry-level workers more than the minimum wage while other firms in the same industry do not? Students review the arguments and evidence on the minimum wage, investigate what economists have learned about its impact, understand why firms might choose to pay more than the minimum wage, review and evaluate current proposals to raise the minimum wage, and explore some of the philosophical and ethical issues raised about labor markets, income inequality, and low income workers. Students may not count both ECON E-1825a and ECON S-1825 for degree credit.|Spring Term 2017|Active learning weekend|24424

From the foods we eat to the goods we buy, the ubiquity of developing countries from Latin America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and former Soviet Union—those frequently referred to as emerging markets—intensifies daily. Yet beyond the well-documented commercial and cultural impacts of globalization, there are strong but less visible trends towards greater global financial and investment integration. What makes emerging financial markets different from those in the US, Europe, or Japan? What are the benefits of adding these markets to a traditional investment portfolio? How do policies shape these markets? Why invest in certain countries versus others? Within a country, which asset class should we invest in? How do hedge funds approach these markets vs. traditional investors? How has the global credit crisis that began in 2007 altered the trajectories of developing and industrialized countries? From the practical perspective of a US institutional investor, this course is geared to help answer these questions. Students develop greater abilities to analyze global macro trends and country fundamentals, master portfolio construction concepts, and implement practical investment strategies.|Fall Term 2016|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|14548
ECON E-1944 History of Financial Crises 1637-2016|John Komlos|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/history-financial-crises-1637-2016/14336|The goal of this course is to discuss the 379-year history of financial crisis ending with the great meltdown of 2008. We ascertain recurring historical patterns of financial bubbles without, however, overlooking critical differences. If history repeats itself, why can't we avoid making the same mistakes over and over again? The great meltdown happened at a time when most macroeconomists (including Nobel Prize winner Bob Lucas as well as none other than the former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke) were writing about the great moderation, that is, that business cycles have vanished for all practical purposes. They, along with most of their colleagues, were dead wrong. The historical evidence enables us to gain a more thorough understanding of the global economy in which we live and work. Our primary aim is not to concentrate on facts, theorems, or numbers but rather to see the big picture in an integrative and multi-disciplinary framework in a very long-run perspective.|Fall Term 2016|Online (live) web conference|14336

Instructional design is a creative process that uses learning theories and frameworks, project planning, content expertise, communication, writing, and technology to architect experiences for today's learners. The best instructional designers are agile and adaptable; they can quickly synthesize unfamiliar content, evaluate new technologies, and develop learning solutions that best meet the needs of a diverse audience. In this course, students work together to produce learning experiences using today's media and technologies. The gap between theory and practice is an issue in many fields. By using a project-based approach, we work to close that gap by learning about instructional design theories and frameworks while developing a series of products; students submit a project every two weeks.

EDUC E-111 Empowering Adult Online Learning: Exploring Theory and Best Practices|Kimberlee Round|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/empowering-adult-online-learning-exploring-theory-best-practices/14804|How do adults learn most effectively online? The online learning environment differs from traditional on-ground approaches and relies heavily on active collaborative techniques to help learners construct knowledge and build community, but why? This course focuses on designing instruction for the unique needs of adult online learners, critically examining related learning theories, instructional design practices, and online teaching strategies. Students examine dynamics that lead to online learning success, developing an appreciation for how adult learning theory informs effective instruction. In addition, as students collaboratively develop online lessons, they utilize design thinking, a framework leveraged by many highly innovative organizations today. In this case, students learn their way into inventive instructional solutions by analyzing adult online learner traits, acquiring interviewing techniques to identify desired learning outcomes, ideating and rapidly creating prototypes, pivoting as brainstorming leads to alternative approaches, and ultimately developing effective learner-centered activities and assessment strategies. Design thinking challenges the designer to develop empathy for stakeholders—in this case, the adult learner. Given a foundation in adult online learning theory, students conduct an empathetic exploration of best practices in designing instruction and online facilitation, comparing and contrasting these approaches, as well as examining quality rubrics published by organizations such as Quality Matters and the Online Learning Consortium. This course is of particular interest to those professionals who contribute to online teaching and learning outcomes in higher education or corporate settings.|Fall Term 2016|Online (live) web conference|14804

Each student prepares a product, such as a course or workshop, social learning community, website, or software application. Using rapid prototyping, students present several iterations of their designs to the class, participate in peer critiques, and continually improve their products over the semester. As instructional designers work in a team, each student contributes to, and benefits from, a class consulting bank. They use their skills to help others and to gain currency that they can exchange for help on their own projects.

EDUC E-150 Educational Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship in Comparative Perspective|Fernando Reimers|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/educational-innovation-social-entrepreneurship-comparative-perspective/23515|This course examines how social entrepreneurs have helped improve the quality of education for low-income and marginalized students.  It focuses especially on initiatives undertaken in developing countries, and, for contrast, compares them with those from early-industrialized countries.  Students also consider the role program theory plays in guiding those efforts in practice. They learn to assess the impact of these efforts and to improve programs based on those assessments. Students study the way social entrepreneurs generate and mobilize resources, negotiate partnerships with the public sector, and create and sustain organizations to support both innovation and the transition to institutionalization.  At the beginning, the course examines the reemergence of public-private partnerships in education, and the role of social entrepreneurs in that process.  Using a series of cases on social entrepreneurs and educational innovation, we discuss how program theory contributes to the success of a particular project, and examine how these projects evolve, from initial design to improving effectiveness and refining program theory, and finally to scale-up and institutionalization.

Because the language has changed so much over 1,000 years, Old English has to be learned as a foreign language (hence the emphasis on grammar) but by the end of one term of study, students read the most challenging and beautiful literature it has to offer.

We also consider some of the more vexing theoretical questions that haunt literary historians as they attempt to generalize about a substantial body of literature such as this—including issues of canonicity, periodization, defining a national literary identity, and the nature of influence. Authors include the Beowulf poet, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Donne, Pope, Fielding, Swift, Johnson, Austen, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, Dickens, Yeats, Eliot, Joyce, and Woolf.

ENGL E-140 The Rise of the Novel|Leo Damrosch|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/rise-novel/14463|Literary narrative goes back to ancient times, but the novel as the term is used today, did not appear until the seventeenth century (Don Quixote and The Princesse de Clèves are celebrated pioneers), and only in the eighteenth century did it establish itself as the dominant literary form of our culture. Recent scholarship on eighteenth-century fiction has focused on themes of current academic interest and on texts that used to be thought of as marginal or inferior. Taking a different tack, this course goes back to the canon: the novels that were long considered the best and most important, both for their achievement in developing the possibilities of narrative, and for their ability to give pleasure to readers. To bring out the particular qualities of each work, scenes from modern film adaptations are shown wherever available. Issues to be considered include genre (what was new about novels? is the novel a genre?); features of omniscient, first person and epistolary narration; representation of character and subjective experience; the social function of fiction; the attractions of plot; the paradoxes of realism; moral didacticism and its subversion; differences between British and French fiction. Novels include Mme. de Lafayette, The Princesse de Clèves (1678), Daniel Defoe, Robinson Crusoe (1719), Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels (1726), Samuel Richardson, Clarissa, or, The History of a Young Lady (1747), Henry Fielding, The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling (1749), Choderlos de Laclos, Les Liaisons Dangereuses (1782), and Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice (1813).

ENGL E-166 The Twentieth-Century American Novel|Peter Becker|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/twentieth-century-american-novel/24239|In this course we read several landmark novels and examples of short fiction. We begin at a time in which many writers left for Europe to leave behind a country they considered provincial while others immigrated to the United States as a refuge. We examine how these continued exchanges across the Atlantic and the experiences of the World Wars and the Holocaust affected and reshaped the rich American novelistic traditions. Proceeding largely in chronological order, the sequence of readings is divided thematically. The readings cluster around the way in which traditional American settings and literary forms interact with and adapt to national and transatlantic historical change. These changes are readily reflected in the novels of immigration, the Lost Generation, and the World Wars, but they also make themselves felt subtly in the way American writers think about the suburb, a direct result of World War II, negotiate the relationship between individualism and the shaping influence of family legacies, and try to grapple with the lasting effects of slavery.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24239
ENGL E-182H Poetry in America: Whitman and Dickinson|Elisa New|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/poetry-america-whitman-dickinson/15089|This course focuses on the poetry of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, two influential and iconic American poets of the nineteenth century. First, we encounter Walt Whitman, a quintessentially American writer whose work continues to bear heavily upon the American poetic tradition. We explore Whitman's relationship to the city, the self, and the body through his life and poetry. Then, we turn to Emily Dickinson, one of America's most distinctive and prolific poets. While Dickinson wrote nearly 2,000 poems during her lifetime, she chose never to publish, opting instead to revisit and revise her works throughout her lifetime. Keeping this dynamic of self-revision in mind, we consider a number of Dickinson's poems—many seemingly in tension with one another—concerned with nature, art, the self, and darkness. We travel to the Dickinson Collection at Harvard's Houghton Library, and to Amherst, Massachusetts, paying a visit to the house in which the poet lived and wrote until her death in 1886.

ENGL E-182M Poetry in America: From the Civil War through Modernism|Elisa New|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/poetry-america-civil-war-through-modernism/15090|This course spans a critical era in American literature, beginning with antebellum and Civil War poetry, entering the twentieth century, and traversing the transformative modernist era. This course begins with the poetry of the American Civil War and the series of major events and social movements that followed it—including Reconstruction, the Jim Crow Era, and Manifest Destiny, to name just a few. Encountering such poets as Herman Melville, Julia Ward Howe, Walt Whitman, Edward Arlington Robinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, James Weldon Johnson, Francis Ellen Watkins Harper, Emma Lazarus and W.E.B. DuBois, we examine the language of patriotism, pride, violence, loss, and memory inspired by the nation's greatest conflict. As we enter the twentieth century, we encounter modernism, a movement that spanned the decades from the 1910s to the mid-1940s, and whose poetry marked a clear break from past traditions and past forms. We read such poets as Robert Frost, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, William Carlos Williams, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Claude McKay, Dorothy Parker, and Wallace Stevens. We study how these poets employed the language of rejection and revolution, of making and remaking, of artistic appropriation and cultural emancipation. Traveling to the homes and workplaces of Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens; to the Poetry Foundation in Chicago, where the institution of American modernism was born; and even exploring the River Thames in the London of Eliot's The Waste Land, we see the sites that witnessed—and cultivated—the rise of American modernism. The recorded lectures are from the HarvardX Poetry in America Series. Students may count ENGL E-182g (offered previously) or ENGL E-182m toward a degree, but not both.|Fall Term 2016|Online only|15090
ENGL E-182A Poetry in America: From the Mayflower through Emerson|Elisa New|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/poetry-america-mayflower-through-emerson/24717|This course covers American poetry in cultural context through the year 1850. The course begins with Puritan poets, some orthodox, some rebel spirits, who wrote and lived in early New England. Focusing on Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, and Michael Wigglesworth, among others, we explore the interplay between mortal and immortal, Europe and wilderness, solitude and sociality in English North America. The second part of the course spans the poetry of America's early years, directly before and after the creation of the Republic. We examine the creation of a national identity through the lens of an emerging national literature, focusing on such poets as Phillis Wheatley, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Edgar Allen Poe, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, among others. Distinguished guest discussants include writer Michael Pollan, economist Larry Summers, Vice President Al Gore, Mayor Tom Menino, and others.

ENGL E-189 The Civil War from Nat Turner to Birth of a Nation|John Stauffer|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/civil-war-nat-turner-birth-nation/24546|This interdisciplinary course examines the American Civil War from Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 to the legendary history film, Birth of a Nation (1915), which coincided with the Jubilee of Appomattox. It changes our understanding of the conflict in three ways. First, by showing that civil war lasted much longer than the four years from 1861-65: it began with guerrilla war between masters and slaves, and between Northerners and Southerners in various states and the US Congress; it evolved into a military war after Fort Sumter; and it became a terrorist war during and after Reconstruction. Second, by arguing that the Confederacy, in some sense, won the war: although the Confederacy was destroyed and the Constitution amended, the former slave owners nonetheless succeeded in creating a new order of black unfreedom. And third, by putting the war in international context: the United States was far from the only nation in the western hemisphere to grapple with slavery and abolition, although it was one of the very few to do so through war. Throughout the course we explore how the war transformed literature, art, politics, history, and memory, while also revealing how these cultural forms shaped society and the war itself. Readings range from fiction, film, letters, and speeches to poetry, pamphlets, prints and photographs, songs, and history. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course United States and the World 34.|Spring Term 2017|Online only|24546

ENGL E-207 The Culture of Capitalism|Martin Puchner|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/culture-capitalism/23886|The course asks how cultural products, including literature, theater, and film have captured the spirit of capitalism—fueling its fantasies, contemplating its effects, and chronicling its crises. More than just an economic system, capitalism created new habits of life and mind as well as new values, forged and distilled by new forms of art. Core readings by Franklin, O'Neill, Rand, Miller, and Mamet and background readings by Smith, Marx, Taylor, Weber, Keynes, and Schumpeter.

ENGL E-213 The Scientist and the Monster: From Frankenstein to Einstein|Sue Weaver Schopf|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/scientist-monster-frankenstein-einstein/24684|When does science go too far? What are (or should be) its limitations? The scientist in literature is often represented as mad because of his willingness to go to any length to advance the cause of science—and never more so than when experiments have unintended consequences or escape the scientist's control. This fear of science and the scientist becomes a serious literary preoccupation during the nineteenth century, when experiments in electricity, reanimation, chemistry, surgery, vivisection, the use of new technologies, and the implications of Darwinism were being widely discussed and their morality questioned. With the birth of the nuclear age in the twentieth century, public anxiety about science and its uses only intensified. This course examines five works that dramatize the dilemma of the scientist when confronting the monstrosities he creates or those over which science appears to be powerless: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886), H. G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), and C. P. Snow's The New Men (1954). We investigate the medical and scientific backgrounds of these works, as well as the authors' unusual storytelling devices. Filmed versions of these works are also viewed and critiqued.|January session|On campus only|24684
ENGL E-219 The War Memoir|Chris Walsh|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/war-memoir/24527|"War is hell," the Vietnam War veteran Tim O'Brien wrote, "but that's not the half of it, because war is mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love. War is nasty; war is fun. War is thrilling; war is drudgery. War makes you a man; war makes you dead." This course explores this powerful and contradictory phenomenon through the intimate accounts of those who, like O'Brien, experienced it first hand, from the Civil War through twenty-first century conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We find common threads through these accounts—compelling tales of fear and camaraderie, horror and honor delivered even as their authors worry that, as Walt Whitman put it, "the real war will never get in the books." We explore how war memoirs have changed, too, both as the nature of war has changed and as the nature of those who fight has changed. In addition to reading texts by men and women, volunteers and conscripts, generals and privates, we also meet war memoirists in person.|January session|On campus only|24527
ENGL E-222 Made for Each Other: Romance, Marriage, and the Novel|Theoharis C. Theoharis|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/made-each-other-romance-marriage-novel/15047|For romance to end in marriage, lovers must adjust themselves, must absorb the disruptions love brings in order to achieve the social prerogatives legitimacy brings. We read two English novels, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen and Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, and two American novels, Washington Square by Henry James and Light in August by William Faulkner, to see how light or heavy the cost of married union may be for lovers, how much cruelty mingles with mercy, and creativity with havoc in the lives of people made for each other.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|15047
ENGL E-223 Love, Death, and other Confusions: The Modern Novella|Theoharis C. Theoharis|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/love-death-other-confusions-modern-novella/24685|It may seem counter-intuitive that short literary works could properly handle life's big issues—love, identity, mortality, ethics, pleasure. But the novellas in this class—comic, somber, absurdist and classical—all prove that, in the hands of great writers, less may be more. The texts are Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Joseph Conrad's The Secret Sharer, Nathaniel West's Miss Lonelyhearts, Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's No One Writes to the Colonel, Marguerite Duras' The Lover, and Eudora Welty's The Ponder Heart.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24685
ENGL E-250 The Unreliable Narrator: Hero, Lunatic, Scoundrel|Lewis H. Miller, Jr.|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/unreliable-narrator-hero-lunatic-scoundrel/24810|One might reasonably conclude that all narrators in fiction or in life are to some extent fallible or unreliable. Our focus specifically engages the question of how selected authors further their artistic purposes by creating narrators who subtly or blatantly confuse appearance and reality, fancy and fact, opportunism and beneficence, opacity and insight. In the process, we address the implications and relevance of such labels as hero, lunatic, scoundrel. Our consideration of narrative strategies leads to an exploration of the manner in which these fictions can illuminate one another and, in the process, deepen our understanding of literature, our own lives, and the lives of others. We read and discuss the following literary works (not necessarily in strict chronological order) with a close eye on the narrators who tell us their stories: Herman Melville's short story, "Bartleby the Scrivener," (1853); Henry James' novella, The Aspern Papers (1888, rev. 1908); Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story, "The Yellow Wallpaper" (1893); Joseph Conrad's novella, The Heart of Darkness (1899); Vladimir Nabokov's novel, Pale Fire (1962); Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, The Remains of the Day (1989); and other short stories by Eudora Welty, "Petrified Man" (1941); William Trevor, "Beyond the Pale" (1981); Russell Banks, "Sarah Cole: A Type of Love Story" (1986); Alice Munro, "Meneseteung," (1988).|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24810
ENGL E-300 Poetry in America for Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop|Elisa New|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/poetry-america-teachers-city-whitman-hip-hop/24718|This course is designed specifically for secondary school educators interested in developing their expertise as readers and teachers of literature. In this course, we consider those American poets whose themes, forms, and voices have given expression to visions of the city since 1850.  Beginning with Walt Whitman, the great poet of nineteenth-century New York, we explore the diverse and ever-changing environment of the modern city—from Chicago to London, from San Francisco to Detroit—through the eyes of such poets as Carl Sandburg, Emma Lazarus, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Langston Hughes, Marianne Moore, Frank O'Hara, Gwendolyn Brooks, Allen Ginsberg, Robert Hayden, and Robert Pinsky, as well as contemporary hip hop and spoken word artists. Deep study of the poems and poets on our syllabus provides an opportunity to develop expertise as classroom educators. As we master advanced strategies for studying American poetry ourselves, we also gain rich new resources for the classroom. This course introduces content and techniques intended to help educators teach their students how to read texts of increasing complexity. Students gain teaching expertise relevant to the Common Core English Language Arts (ELA) standards in grades six through 12.

ENVR E-103 Energy and Climate: Vision for the Future|Michael B. McElroy|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/energy-climate-vision-future/24429|The climate of our planet is changing at a rate unprecedented in human history. Primarily responsible is the build-up of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, most notably carbon dioxide emitted in conjunction with the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas.  Concentrations in the atmosphere of CO2 are higher now than at any time over at least the past 850,000 years, higher arguably than at any time since dinosaurs roamed the planet 50 million years ago. The course provides a perspective on what we may expect in the way of future climate change if we fail to take action—more violent storms, extremes of precipitation, heat waves, pressures on food production, and an inexorable rise in sea level. It surveys the energy choices available should we elect to take action to minimize future damage to the climate system. Special attention is directed to the challenges and opportunities confronting China and the US, the world's two largest current emitters. The overall goal is to develop a vision for a more sustainable environmental future, one in which energy is supplied not by climate-altering fossils fuels but rather by zero carbon alternatives such as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, tidal, and nuclear.

ENVR E-119D Zero Energy in the Built Space|Paul Ormond|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/zero-energy-built-space/24776|Zero energy buildings, also known as net zero energy buildings are buildings (or a community of buildings) which produce with on-site renewables the same amount of energy as they consume, on an annual basis. Typically, a zero energy building consists of a highly-efficient building with rooftop, or site mounted, photovoltaic system. Zero energy is very scalable from single family homes to large commercial buildings to districts or communities of buildings. Once the realm of the most ambitious building owners willing to take significant financial risks, experience, technology, and financing mechanisms have begun to evolve to the point where a zero energy building can cost less to own and operate than a traditional code building. Indeed, Massachusetts is now beginning to see the emergence of spec-built zero energy homes, targeted at the affordable, low-income housing market. Other emerging trends include Executive Order 13514, which requires all new federal buildings to be designed to be zero energy by 2030, as well as various state and municipal initiatives. In the next few decades, it's possible that a large portion of new construction could be zero energy, either by code or by economics. This course provides a comprehensive exploration of zero energy buildings including building energy dynamics and renewable system fundamentals; energy economics, energy budgets, and site and source energy; relevant policy, codes, financing, and incentive structures; state of practice in zero energy design and construction, for both residential scale and commercial/institutional scale; case studies to demonstrate feasibility, key concepts, and lessons learned; the benefits and challenges zero energy imposes on the energy grid; the value zero energy can have in advancing security and resilience.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24776

ENVR E-140 Fundamentals of Ecology|Mark Leighton|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/fundamentals-ecology/12779|This course introduces basic concepts in the ecology of individual organisms, their populations, and the biological communities in which they live. Emphasis is on terrestrial plant and animal ecology. The historical, evolutionary, and ecological processes determining the distribution of ecosystems, habitats, and species are introduced. Evolutionary processes responsible for the adaptations of individuals are examined to understand the diversity of species and their features. Theories of competition, predation, disease, and mutualism help explain the functioning of biological communities. These fundamentals establish a basis for examining the challenges imposed by humans on the functioning of natural ecosystems. The sustainable harvesting and use of natural resources, the implications of human population growth and size, and the transformation of natural communities through human activities and policies are examined in this ecological context. The course features a weekend field trip and other activities.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|12779
ENVR E-143 Sustainability Challenges for Rural Landscapes—Evaluating American versus European Practices and Policies from Tuscany|Mark Leighton|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/sustainability-challenges-rural-landscapes-evaluating-american-versus-european|This course explores historical and current practices and policies that could function to promote sustainable human and natural landscapes. It consists of weekly lectures and discussions during the semester that contrast American versus European approaches to sustaining rural landscapes of mixed land uses, especially organic agriculture, but also agritourism, forestry, and biodiversity conservation. The course focuses on comparisons between New England and Tuscany; in both these regions, ecological and economic sustainability challenges in the rural landscape include the production of local food and wood products for niche markets, managing watersheds, conserving biodiversity, and other environmental services, such as carbon sequestration, and diversifying income streams with ecotourism. Optimizing this mix of functions while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, other forms of pollution, and energy consumption addresses sustainability goals.
The centerpiece of the course is an intensive—and mandatory—two week learning experience, April 30-May 13, in residence at Spannocchia, a historical Tuscan estate property near Sienna. The educational mission of the Spannocchia Foundation is to promote sustainability in organic agriculture and animal husbandry, forestry, biodiversity conservation, ecotourism, and energy and waste management practices. Students work in small teams, conducting fieldwork on the 1,200 acres of the estate, evaluating models for these practices from ecological, economic, and policy perspectives, and debating creative ideas for sustainability futures in this inspirational setting with local experts. These field exercises and discussions at Spannocchia are augmented with two all day trips: one to a biodynamic winery site and onwards to San Gimignano, the second a Saturday in nearby Siena. Students should not have other work or study commitments during this period.
The course involves some hiking and fieldwork on several days over uneven ground; because these are critical course activities, students must be physically able to participate. Although mild, sunny spring weather is common, unusually cold and rainy or hot days can occur, not unlike New England. Rooms in the Villa and Fattoria at Spannocchia are shared doubles, spacious and historical. Meals feature organic products from the estate. View the Spannocchia website for photos and descriptions of accommodations, programs, and the estate property. Students with documented disabilities should contact the accessibility services office no later than two weeks before the course begins. Costs: in addition to the course tuition, students are responsible for: 1,100 Euros (approximately $1,250 at the current exchange rate) paid to Spannocchia by January 25. This includes room and board, April 30-May 13.US health insurance that provides coverage outside the United States.
Transportation to Florence and from Sienna. The cost of passports and visas (if the latter is needed). A bus will transport students from the Florence airport to Spannocchia on April 30 and from Spannocchia to Florence on May 13.|Spring Term 2017|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|24236
ENVR E-151 Life Cycle and Supply Chain Sustainability Assessment|Gregory A. Norris|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/life-cycle-supply-chain-sustainability-assessment/13749|The field of industrial ecology includes advanced tools and methods to assist practitioners seeking to redesign and realign industrial systems and activities to be more ecologically and socially sound. Central within the field of industrial ecology is life cycle assessment (LCA), which involves systems analysis of the full range of environmental impacts, product life cycles, and supply chains. More recently, social impacts are also being addressed in life cycles and supply chains, leading to the definition of life cycle sustainability assessment. This course enables participants to develop a hands-on, in-depth understanding of the frameworks, principles, tools, and applications of life cycle assessment. As part of the course, students learn to use and apply professional software tools and databases that address both social and environmental impacts in global supply chains. We also review the state of life cycle practice and current initiatives involving companies, governments, and NGOs. We ground the entire course on the goal of making human activities, from the personal to the global, truly sustainable.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|13749

ENVR E-158B Introduction to the Circular Economy|Carrie S. Snyder|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-circular-economy/24785|Today, economic growth is primarily contingent on increased resource consumption. In this linear economic approach, businesses harvest or extract materials, use them to grow or manufacture products, and then sell those products to consumers—who generally incinerate or send to landfill the materials that no longer serve their original purpose. As the population grows and resources become increasingly scarce, this take, make, waste model is quickly reaching its limits. The circular economy, by contrast, is one that is "restorative and regenerative by design, and aims to keep products, components and materials at their highest utility and value at all times" (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2013). It decouples economic growth from resource consumption. Recently attracting increased attention, the circular economy philosophy is an emerging field of study, promoting a systemic, cross-disciplinary approach.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24785
ENVR E-160 Critical Thinking about Issues of Environmental and Public Health|David P. Ropeik|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/critical-thinking-about-issues-environmental-public-health/24572|Our ideas about complex environmental and public health issues such as climate change, industrial chemicals, and species extinction are largely formed by simplistic and dramatized media coverage and distorting political spin from all sides. In this course, students learn how to think about these issues more carefully. As a result, their views and perspectives are better informed and their choices are more intelligent and healthier for them and their families. Topics include risk perception—the psychology that explains why we are often more afraid of lesser risks and less afraid of bigger ones, and how that perception gap can be dangerous; media coverage of environmental and public health issues; risk analysis—the controversy over choosing policy options based on economics; the risk sciences of epidemiology and toxicology—what they can and cannot tell us; and hormesis—the discovery by toxicologists that small exposures to toxic substances may be beneficial. Other issues include endocrine disruption, radiation, air pollution (indoor and outdoor), pesticides, major causes of death (heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and accidents), and emerging infectious diseases.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24572
ENVR E-161A Advancing Sustainability through Land Conservation Practice in the United States and Around the World|Henry Tepper|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/advancing-sustainability-through-land-conservation-practice-united-states-around|This course focuses on the extraordinary growth and success of public and private land conservation in the United States and abroad during the past forty years. We delve into the origins of land conservation and its development, in the context of the broader environmental movement, in the United States and around the world. Early lectures review the first major trend in land protection, which was the creation of public parks, forests, and nature preserves, including landmark actions to create emblematic landscapes like the Boston Common, Yellowstone and Yosemite National Parks, and the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Our focus then shifts to what has become one of the best-kept secrets in conservation—the dramatic growth, effectiveness, scale, and practicality of private land conservation. We discuss the range of practice of land trusts in the US, including public-private conservation partnerships, and we address the growing but under-recognized private lands conservation efforts outside the US. We pay special attention to the building blocks of private and public land conservation, including financial incentives; practical and flexible legal agreements and instruments; financing mechanisms; entities to facilitate these projects, including land trusts; protection criteria; community values; and the growing importance of climate change issues in land protection.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|15150

It is intended for both students with and without technical backgrounds. We use numerous case studies from the instructor's experience as a consultant to the US Environmental Protection Agency, state and local governments, industry, and nongovernmental organizations. To the extent possible, the course includes a field trip to visit actual project sites in the metro-Boston region. The course is organized into a series of technical/foundation classes, followed by several resource and issue-specific focused sessions, and completed with discussions about possible management strategies/techniques and adaptive management approaches. The course examines groundwater, lake, riverine, wetland, and coastal management issues at the local, state, tribal, regional, national, and international levels and relies heavily on practical case studies. We focus on an integrated water management approach that links drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater management—seeking opportunities to keep water local and for re-use, balancing hydrologic budgets, and minimizing costs in the face of climate change. A broad range of water resource management strategies is examined including structural/nonstructural, regulatory/nonregulatory, and prevention/restoration approaches. Smart growth and low impact development techniques are presented as effective growth management and climate adaptation techniques. Incentive-based management strategies are presented to modify behaviors and to optimize public participation.

ENVR E-171 Water, Health, and Sustainable Development|Joseph Michael Hunt|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/water-health-sustainable-development/24549|According to Fortune, water promises to be to the twenty-first century what oil was to the twentieth century: the precious commodity that determines the wealth of nations. And the health of nations as well. This course introduces students to environmental assessment methods of water projects and programs, including health impact assessment, that contribute significantly to health protection and environmental sustainability. The course takes three approaches to the water question. The first, a new sustainable development goal (2015-2030), targets water supply and sanitation (WSS) for all. Lectures identify causes of slow progress in the least developed countries and examine how the lives of 2,000 children lost unnecessarily every day to enteric diseases could be saved. We analyze three contributing risk factors (access to WSS, girls' education and life expectancy, and food security including dietary quality). Case studies are drawn from South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The second approach studies women, watersheds, and the welfare of children, and looks at climate change, persistent drought, and the reclamation of river basins for meeting human needs. We also examine managing the water-energy nexus for population health, with detailed investigation of the future prospects of hydropower as a low carbon source of electricity in rural areas given climate uncertainties, potential biodiversity losses, and peripheral spread of infectious and vector-borne diseases. The third approach involves water planning, technology, and management for healthy cities. The United Nations projects that three-fifths of humanity will live in cities by 2030, and by 2050 one-third may exist in a state of congealed misery in informal urban settlements without suitable aerated housing or affordable water and sanitation facilities. Coastal cities face the further threat of rising sea levels as a direct risk to life and indirect risk to potable water security. Harvard's extensive policy and planning research on China's healthy cities initiative is an important theme for the course. At course end, students apply practical methods that inform prudent investment decisions on water security and safety, and describe evidence-based water planning paradigms that support economic growth, social and health development, and environmental sustainability.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24549

EXPO E-39 Advanced Essay Writing|Chris Walsh|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/advanced-essay-writing/24533|This course aims to help students become writers. Building on fundamental prose skills they have already mastered, students explore the essay form in all its variety and complexity, striving to discover those approaches that feel most natural and effective to them. By reading, discussing, and emulating exemplary work from the long and enduring tradition of essay writing, students cultivate more sophisticated ways to persuade, inform, and move readers. Accomplished professional essayists and editors visit the class, and students choose texts from the best contemporary essayists as well as from writers such as Montaigne, Hazlitt, Woolf, Orwell, Baldwin, Dillard, Stephen Jay Gould, David Foster Wallace, and others. With the help of inspiring models and the feedback of their classmates, students cultivate their own voices as writers—their authority—in whatever fields interest them, within academia or outside of it.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24533

GOVT E-1207 Capitalism as a System of Governance|Bruce R. Scott|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/capitalism-system-governance/14754|Capitalism emerged in Europe in the period 1400-1800 and since 1990 it has been the prevailing system of economic governance the world over. In spite of this prevailing position, and the fact that the term itself was coined in 1850, capitalism has no generally accepted definition and is often assumed to be almost co-extensive with markets. In the instructor's view, capitalism is a complex, socially created system of indirect economic governance which employs both hierarchy and markets to allocate resources, and is built upon the rule of law, and therefore constitutional government, which defies simple definition and is often misunderstood and/or misused.  This course aims to explain and build upon a definition of capitalism which is grounded in the study of political economy. It begins from the proposition that there are no markets without market frameworks, and these market frameworks are created and regulated by governments and not the economic actors themselves. This view is, in many respects, analogous to a view of competition in organized sports, where the sporting competition takes place in frameworks created and indeed supervised by sporting authorities and not the athletes themselves. And, as with sports, there are no free or unregulated markets. The course begins with four classes designed to explore how capitalism and democracy co-exist, overlap, and influence each other.  The next four classes examine capitalism's historical origins in Europe and its spread to the western hemisphere, and the remaining seven classes consider how capitalism and democracy have transformed each other in the US since 1830, including the two transformations from social democratic capitalism to a more oligarchic form. The course also considers several specific examples of institutional innovations, such as regulation of new drugs and US permission for firms to repurchase their own shares, as well as the attempt to establish capitalism in a post-conflict situation in Bosnia.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|14754

GOVT E-1353 Leadership Lessons from Modern Presidential Politics|John Paul Rollert|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/leadership-lessons-modern-presidential-politics/24062|Presidential campaigns share much in common with start-up ventures. Capital must be raised; a large, diverse team must be organized and deployed; and a brand must be developed and sold. The hours are long, the pressure is incredibly intense, and the stakes couldn't be higher. Succeed, and you're on your way to the White House. Fail, and you're left looking for a job. Accordingly, presidential campaigns provide remarkable lessons in compelling leadership and successful management. This course aims to harvest them by way of an analysis of the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns as well as the first and second terms of President Barack Obama. Though emphasis is placed on presidential politics, the lessons may be applied across the public and private sector. Our readings are drawn from history, literature, philosophy, business, and politics. In addition to lectures and discussion, this course also features guest speakers from the Romney campaign and the Obama White House.|January session|On campus only|24062
GOVT E-1354 Ideas About Leadership: Theoretical, Historical, and Personal Frameworks|Mary Raum|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/ideas-about-leadership-theoretical-historical-personal-frameworks/15096|Leadership moves the world. That's why it is important, why we study it and why we strive to do it well. It is a research area, a practical skill, and a personal philosophy. Thoughts about leading have evolved over time to include broad categorizations of transactional transformational, behavioral, and situational approaches. Numerous examples of leading exist across generations which serve as examples to bridge theory with reality. The course is designed to meet three objectives. First is to become acquainted with several of the primary theoretical ideas about leading. Second is to introduce illustrations of current or historical leaders and situations to enrich the theoretical assertions. Third is to participate in an active self reflection about leadership qualities, strengths, and weaknesses.

GOVT E-1356 The Road to the White House|Carlos E.

It studies the origins and evolution of the presidential selection process and explores how modern campaigns inform, influence, and mobilize voters. Topics to be studied include the role of political parties and candidates, campaign strategies and tactics, political advertising and media coverage, campaign finance and voter mobilization, and the transition from campaigning to governing. The 2016 campaign is used as a laboratory in which to explore political science research on presidential campaigns and elections. After taking this course, students are able to analyze and evaluate the conduct of presidential campaigns and elections in the United States, exhibit a thorough understanding of our electoral system, and critically engage the literature on presidential campaigns and elections and how it relates to the current electoral process.

GOVT E-1368 Saving Schools: History, Politics, and Policy in US Education|Paul E. Peterson|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/saving-schools-history-politics-policy-us-education/14604|The first part of this course seeks to explore how a school system, once the envy of the world, stumbled so that, in 2012, the performance in math, science, and reading of US students at age 15 fell below that of students in a majority of the world's industrialized nations. Examining the history and politics of US education, we identify the personalities and historical forces—progressivism, racial desegregation, legalization and collective bargaining—that shaped and re-shaped US school politics and policy. Subsequent sections of the course seek answers to a second question: What are the best ways of lifting the performance of American schools to a higher level? To explore these questions, we look at ideas and proposals of those who want to save our schools—either by reforming the teaching profession, holding schools accountable, or giving families more school choices. By speaking with reform proponents and independent experts, we capture the intensity of the current debate. In the end, we do not find any silver bullets that can magically lift schools to a new level of performance, but we do pinpoint the pluses and minuses of many new approaches to saving schools under consideration today. The recorded lectures are from the HarvardX course "Saving Schools: History, Politics, and Policy in US Education."|Fall Term 2016|Online only|14604

This course addresses major ways Manet's resolutely independent artistic vision transformed the art of painting. These included his subjects—scandalous!—, his technique—too bold!—, and his strategies in Paris, the most competitive cultural center in Europe at the time. We also consider Manet's posthumous legacy, a fascinating subject engaging impressionism, post-impressionism, and Picasso. Masterpieces like Déjeuner sur l'herbe, Olympia, The Execution of Maxmilian, Portrait of Émile Zola, and Bar at the Folies Bergère are examined in detail, and Manet's relations with colleagues, critics, and collectors discussed.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|15175
HARC E-173 Modern in Spirit:  American Art in the First Half of the Twentieth Century|Cynthia A. Fowler|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/modern-spirit-american-art-first-half-twentieth-century/24711|Art historians generally agree that American art found its place in the international art world at mid-century with the rise of abstract expression and artists like the celebrated painter Jackson Pollock. But the first half of the twentieth century, although not as widely recognized, is a rich time period in the history of American modern art that deserves equal consideration as an innovative and experimental time for American art. Indeed, this time period is a far more eclectic one and characterized by a more inclusive philosophy about modern art. Georgia O'Keeffe, one of the best known painters from this time period, demonstrates through her painting that experimentation with abstraction was a key interest among these artists. But there is much more to American modernism than O'Keeffe's paintings. For example, the French artist Marcel Duchamp introduced Dada to America, most notoriously through his urinal turned art, Fountain (1917), now one of the most celebrated works of twentieth-century art. This course examines a complex array of art movements in America, including Dada, surrealism, and synchromism to demonstrate the rich cultural history that defines this time period. New Deal art and social realism are also examined. Inclusive in its approach, the course examines important modernist textiles by artists such as Marguerite Zorach, whose large-scale embroideries demonstrate the shared perspective among American modernists that creativity could be equally expressed in any medium. More broadly, the course considers the contributions of American artists working in the first half of the twentieth century to the development of American modern art as a whole.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24711

City and suburb are experienced as the product of design and planning decisions informed by cultural and economic forces, and in relationship to utopian and pragmatic efforts to reinterpret urban traditions in search of American alternatives. Topics include persistent ideals such as the single-family home, attitudes toward public and private space, the rise of suburbs and suburban sprawl, cycles of disinvestment and renewed interest in urban centers, and impacts of mobility and technology on settlement patterns.

We can look to the humanities to help answer this question. For example, identifying a poem's characteristics—its form, rhyme, meter, imagery, and so forth—can enrich one's understanding of the poet's artistic intent and the meaning ascribed to the work today. What are the analogous methods for understanding a work of architecture? Through first-hand observation students in this course learn how to analyze a work of architecture.

This course treats it as a case study around which a range of topics is organized. The first third examines the museum's 1870 foundation and early years, how and why it defined its original mission, its collections, and its staffing and programming. Special consideration is given the museum's reinvention around 1900, relocation to a new building, and the forces driving its new goals. The remaining two-thirds address the MFA's evolution in the twentieth century, including growth of the collections, role of major directors, patrons, and exhibitions, and changing ideas about display, interpretation, and visitor experience. Not least, the MFA's recent expansion and its dynamic role in contemporary culture is also examined. Here complex issues confront it, ranging from the ethics of acquisitions to controversial exhibition content, all of them raising key questions about the art museum of the future.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24795

It provides a survey from the fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the French Revolution in 1789. Early modern Europe experienced artistic flourishing and transformative new scientific, religious, and philosophical ideas. But it was also a period of extreme bloodshed and violence with a thirty-year war, numerous uprisings, and conflicts between princes, popes, and principalities fighting for control. These developments spread far beyond Europe itself through colonization and global travel and our course considers how European expansion affected those in Europe as well as abroad. Our major topics include the Renaissance and Reformation, empires and overseas imperialism, religious conflict and wars, printing, the scientific revolution, state formation, the Republic of Letters, and the Enlightenment. The geographical focus isn't simply on Western Europe but also incorporates Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe. We read many of the major figures of the period, including Machiavelli, da Vinci, Luther, Montaigne, Comenius, Voltaire, Rousseau, Bacon, Kant, and Tocqueville.

Through class readings and discussions of Lincoln's most notable as well as lesser-known writings, the course examines the private and public man in historical context—as a product of the cultural and intellectual currents of the nineteenth century—and in American memory as an image and symbol of national values and ideals. The course studies Lincoln as an aspiring poet, humorous storyteller, awkward suitor, ambitious and shrewd politician, resilient and resolute commander-in-chief, and president, whose enormous capacity for growth enabled him to overcome the prejudices of his time to restore the founding principles of American republicanism and freedom. Lincoln's writings on the most critical issues of his time, including the role of government in the lives of its citizens, racial equality and slavery, the legality of secession, and civil liberties in time of war are analyzed and discussed.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|15093

The modern society and state that is emerging in China bears the indelible imprint of China's historical experience, of its patterns of philosophy and religion, and of its social and political thought. These themes are discussed in order to understand China in the twenty-first century and as a great world civilization that developed along lines different from those of the Mediterranean.

HSCI E-128 The Empire Strikes Back: Science Fiction, Religion, and Society|Ahmed Ragab|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/empire-strikes-back-science-fiction-religion-society/14820|From the seventeenth century to today, science fiction has reflected the aspirations of scientific innovation and anticipated new discoveries. It has reflected rhetorical practices by which science melds present contexts with futurism, extrapolation, and promissory logics. Authors have engaged with ethical problems, fears about innovations gone awry, and pessimism about the prospects of technological development, all while critiquing views on gender, race, and sexuality, and subverting colonial ambitions while engaging postcolonial aspirations. At the same time, science fiction has engaged religious and spiritual views, both interacting with religious imaginaries and engaging with the role of religion in society and in relation to science. In this course, we trace science fiction through history. We analyze how it has understood science and technology, war and colonialism, sex, race and gender, health and disease.

It is the object of health and disease, birth and death, reward and punishment, and is the vehicle of both the divine and the profane. It is at the center of debates on sexuality, gender identities, race, and politics. In this course, we look at how different views on the body and on sexuality developed and changed in the Middle East throughout the medieval period and how they influenced and were influenced by the religious doctrines, the medical theories, the Islamic law, and the intellectual environment of the Islamic Middle Ages. The course addresses these different views and perceptions as manifested in the religious, philosophical, legal, scientific, and literary production of the period.

Through Frida's life and artwork, we see how two international influences in Mexico's cultural and political life—Soviet politics and French surrealism—merged with national agendas that sought to redefine Mexico's identity through the integration of their indigenous heritage. The result was a time of booming creativity in the arts, radical expansion of educational and political agendas, as well as a redefinition of women's identity, sexuality, and the Mexican family. We trace her romantic and artistic relationship with Diego Rivera and explore her impact on the intensely creative social circle that included composer Carlos Chávez, photographers Lola Álvarez Bravo and Manual Álvarez Bravo as well as Tina Modotiti, Finally, the course includes a visit to the Fogg Museum for local students to see some of the Mexican muralist art work on display, and also a visit to the Museum of Fine Arts to see the newly acquired painting by Frida Kahlo, Dos mujeres.

IT managers and executives must communicate complex information and initiatives that improve productivity, cost management, and competitive advantage. To support better consideration of the factors driving technology decisions and formal cost recovery methodologies, the IT professional must present data and strategies to both other IT professionals and lay people without an IT background—to executives, management, and staff within their organizations and to outside vendors and suppliers. Often, IT professionals must work and communicate productively in teams. This course focuses on the processes that make it possible to fairly allocate costs for IT services and gain information for assessing options, managing consumption, and perceiving the true value of IT; and the means of conveying information to ensure understanding and gain the cooperation of key partners in initiating positive IT financial initiatives|Spring Term 2017|Online only|24784

ISMT E-599A Capstone Seminar in Information Management|Richard E. Joltes|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/capstone-seminar-information-management/24506|The management and utilization of digital assets, especially those containing large amounts of unstructured text, represent an ongoing and rapidly growing challenge for all types of enterprises. In many cases, a large amount of textual content is created and stored on a daily basis, only to languish unused in forgotten archives until discarded or forgotten. In the intervening storage period, this content consumes valuable storage space and other resources that may be better utilized for other purposes, while producing no tangible benefit. Given the rapid growth of such content (the data captured by IoT devices alone is expected to exceed 1.6 Zettabytes by 2020), what steps should enterprises take in order to manage and capitalize on it? Is it possible to glean useful, actionable insights from unstructured text, while not wreaking havoc on already strained IT budgets? How should projects intended to utilize this content be organized, and what objectives and success metrics should be established? Even more importantly, how can organizations plan for the future in the face of burgeoning, almost exponential growth in content and complexity? This course discusses approaches to these problems. We first cover the backdrop of today's storage nightmare and how it has evolved over time, then proceed to an assessment of the current state of unstructured content management. Using this background material, students then extrapolate on existing trends and needs for an organization (real or fictional), ultimately producing both short and long term plans of some duration (say, three to five years) for the organization's management and utilization of unstructured content.|Spring Term 2017|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|24506

LSTU E-116 Childhood, Adolescence, Youth, and International Human Rights|Jacqueline Bhabha|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/childhood-adolescence-youth-international-human-rights/15166|Since ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 25 years ago, considerable progress has been made in advancing young children's enjoyment of basic social and economic rights including access to basic education and health care. These gains are not matched by corresponding advances for older children, particularly girls, minorities, and migrants: in many developing societies, secondary and tertiary education remains widely inaccessible, maternal mortality remains the largest cause of female teenage death, and youth unemployment and violence have reached epidemic proportions. What explains this differential performance, and how can the gap in realization of adolescent and youth human rights be addressed? The course explores legal and other strategies for understanding and advancing the human rights of children, adolescents, and youth globally.

LSTU E-141 Legal Reasoning|William J. Eisen|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/legal-reasoning/14602|This course considers the connection between language and thinking, and its role in legal reasoning. How do lawyers think and reason differently from the layman, and how can legal analysis be used by managers who have decisions to make? This is not a course about law; it is about relationships, roles, influences, and the subjectivity of what appears certain. Lawyers work with facts, theories, and rules, like all of us do, and in this course we try to identify the relationship between these concepts, and consider how lawyers grapple with them in a professional way. Are there such things as facts, theories, and rules, or are they just amorphous concepts we have invented? Is there a place for morality in this conversation about facts, theories, and rules? By looking at situations loaded with conflicts and questions, we try to think about them in new ways. We consider how various professionals, particularly managers and lawyers, relate to, discuss, examine, and resolve these problems differently. What are the sources of these different approaches? Language? Temperament? The duties and scopes of their professions? As we consider different ways to think, we become conscious of our own thought processes, and how our thoughts and perspectives change as we consider and reconsider the same problems.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|14602

MATH E-300 Mathematical Foundations for Teaching Secondary School Math|Andrew Engelward|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/mathematical-foundations-teaching-secondary-school-math/13787|Why do students have such a difficult time with basic math concepts such as working with fractions and negative numbers? It could be because arithmetic is significantly more complex than we initially suspect. For instance, the symbol ½ has at least four different interpretations, and students need to be able to quickly figure out which interpretation will be of most use for solving a particular problem. This course was created for middle and high school mathematics teachers to give them a chance to explore the inner workings of fundamental mathematical concepts involved in arithmetic as well as the basis for working with a variety of number systems. The course deconstructs basic math concepts that many people often take for granted, but yet which can continue to give students difficulties throughout their school years. The course emphasizes mathematical reasoning rather than memorizing facts and formulas. In addition to the mathematical content, we also discuss how different methods of teaching affect students differently and we explore a variety of activities and games that teachers can bring to their own classrooms to enhance their students' understanding and enjoyment of mathematics.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|13787

The struggle of early research mathematicians who developed and formalized a topic parallels the struggle of students and teachers in the modern classroom. Students learning about the concept of limits and series undergo a similar process as the pioneers of calculus did when they developed the subject. Archimedes, Zeno, Cavalieri, Newton, Leibniz, and Cauchy had to find or invent structure. This struggle goes on today, as new flavors of calculus are developed and studied.

MGMT E-2035 Principles of Real Estate|Teo Nicolais|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/principles-real-estate/14821|The purpose of this course is to offer practical, real-world knowledge for engaging in real estate investment. It is great both for students pursuing an active fulltime career in the industry as well as for students interested in building wealth through passive real estate holdings. No prior real estate or finance background is required. The first step in becoming an investor is understanding the fundamental nature of the great real estate stage. Students learn to uncover the hidden forces that drive land values. They develop a framework for identifying a property's natural (comparative) advantages so they can determine its most profitable use. They study what causes properties, neighborhoods, and cities to develop and change over time. Students learn that what we think of as the real estate market is not one but two parallel markets: the space market and the asset market. By studying the interaction between these two markets, students learn how to monitor the boom-bust cycles which lead to investment opportunities. Equipped with a fundamental understanding of what drives real estate values, students receive intensive, hands-on experience building financial models, analyzing cash flows, and measuring economic returns of real estate investments in Microsoft Excel. They learn how entrepreneurs raise capital through debt and equity partnerships. Finally, they explore the practical steps for managing a real estate investment enterprise. Emphasis is placed on practical decision-making experience by working through real world investment situations. Students also examine specific strategies for building wealth through real estate investment and identify which work best for them.|Fall Term 2016|Online only|14821

For each model studied, students are expected  to understand the theoretical basis of the model, the strengths and weaknesses of said model, and how to apply the model to practical situations in business and other settings. Second, students explore their personal leadership style through a series of written assignments and classroom activities. These activities enable the student to reflect on how they view leadership as both a subordinate and as a leader. As a result of enrolling in this class, students develop a well-rounded understanding of leadership concepts for use in their own leadership opportunities.

It focuses on the qualities, subtleties, ambiguities, and dilemmas of leadership as they appear in in the eyes of some of the keenest observers of human nature, namely, creative artists. Students are asked to share their personal management experiences as they relate to the readings. When appropriate, references to academic studies and theories of leadership are also made.

MGMT E-4230 Advanced Negotiation and Conflict Resolution Strategies: Mastering the Science and Art|Maurie Kelly|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/advanced-negotiation-conflict-resolution-strategies-mastering-science-art/24814|We all have had experiences where we find ourselves in the company of a master negotiator. You most likely can name someone you admire, someone whose abilities you wish you had. These individuals seem to know how to turn a hopeless situation into an amazing agreement. You may think they were born that way but this is rarely true. In order to be a master negotiator, you must be a master of both the science and the art. You need to have a deep understanding of the basics as well as keen insight into when to create and when to claim value, how to structure a negotiation, and how to address barriers. You should be able to be a master architect in designing your negotiation, long before you ever get to the table. It is imperative that you understand how to bring in new elements, partners, processes that make up your negotiation campaign. Finally, the proof of your mastery of the science and your entree into the art is when you are faced with a truly complex situation and understand how to put the science of strategy and experience into action. Becoming a master negotiator requires a solid foundation in negotiation concepts; the ability to structure and execute complex negotiations strategically; experience, but an ongoing desire to learn and grow; expertise in set up and design, agility and flexibility; empathy, sensitivity, and creativity; multidimensional thinking and planning; crisis leadership skills; system 2 thinking; and constant mindful practice. This highly interactive course delves into the strategic system 2 thinking and planning that drive success in multiple arenas including multiparty negotiations, international coalitions, and multiphase situations. We explore impossible situations, deadlocked conflicts, and interpersonal, organizational, and international disputes and learn the skills required to address these scenarios. You develop more sophisticated negotiating skills, learn how to avoid the most serious pitfalls, and emerge prepared to conduct a wider range of complex negotiations and resolve conflicts with confidence.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24814

MGMT E-5002 Business Strategy in the Real World|Daniel C. Deneffe|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/business-strategy-real-world/24183|This course is about how to develop, tailor and apply decision-making frameworks to real world strategy problems. It complements standard strategy courses in a number of important ways. Whereas standard strategy courses typically provide conceptual approaches to formulate strategies to establish sustainable competitive advantage, we focus on short- to medium-term margin improvement. The majority of the course content focuses on hands-on tools and frameworks that help strategic and marketing managers formulate strategy to obtain short-to medium term advantages rather than long term competitive advantage. In standard strategy courses a number of theoretically sound frameworks of analysis are introduced. This course builds on them but focuses on the how question: Which framework is relevant for what problem? What are the key operational steps to approach a strategy problem (such as entry into a market), and how does one tailor them to the specific company and industry situation? In standard strategy case-based courses, students typically learn to provide strategic solutions from given case information whereas a real world strategy problem often has a blank sheet as a starting point. This course addresses questions such as: How do we gather the right information to address a strategic issue, given real world informational constraints? How do we process that information for improved decision-making?|January session|On campus only|24183

MGMT E-5015 Applied Corporate Responsibility|Charles Bradford Allen|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/applied-corporate-responsibility/24482|This course examines the role of corporate responsibility as a strategy to improve products, profits, and brand equity. The idea of corporations as simply wealth-creating organizations with no obligations to the environment is no longer acceptable. Globalization and increased transparency of corporate operations have revealed significant variations in how organizations attempt to balance the pursuit of profits and good corporate citizenship. Expectations for measurable progress of corporate environmental programs addressing natural resources, pollution controls, monitoring ethical supply chains, and expanded training of employees are growing globally. Stakeholder expectations have accelerated the need to monetize these initiatives. However, the lack of standardized methodology and metrics has resulted in confusion within many industries, hindering progress. Tracking sustainability progress within organizations has often revealed tremendous opportunities for growth.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24482

MGMT E-5061 Managing Service Design and Operations|Ramiro Jara|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/managing-service-design-operations/14270|We live in a global service economy. The percentage of people employed in services has steadily increased in every developed country, exceeding 80 percent in the US in 2010. In 2011, an estimated 79.6 percent of the US GDP was created by the services sector. Emerging economies have similarly seen explosive growth in the percentage of their workforce employed in the provision of services, as trends as offshoring and outsourcing become more prevalent. This course explores how leaders design service experiences and systems to manage employees and customers to consistently deliver exceptional and profitable services. Through case studies from a variety of industries (retail, banking, technology), and the sharing of professional experiences, students gain practical insights that can be readily applied in the workplace. In the first part of the course, we discuss operational topics, including the trade-offs involved in the service model, the customer and management systems, and the funding mechanism. We touch upon customer satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability. The concepts of service journey, capacity, and demand management cap this section of the course. We then embark onto a series of interactive highly practical workshops designed to study design thinking, with a specific focus on the service design toolset. Students gain proficiency in human-centered approaches such as blueprinting, customer journeys, and the hear-create-deliver methodology.

MGMT E-5090 Crisis Management and Emergency Preparedness|Arnold M. Howitt|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/crisis-management-emergency-preparedness/13601|Crises challenge organizations to respond creatively to high-stakes and novel circumstances. Today not only traditional emergency responders (police, firefighters, and emergency medical teams) must be ready for crises, but also private and nonprofit organizations, as well as a wider spectrum of public sector responders (for example, public health, transportation, and public works). Through study of cases of a range of actual crises and of conceptual frameworks for understanding the dynamics of crises, this course takes a managerial perspective on crisis management and emergency preparedness. It focuses both on what responders must do during the critical period of crisis response and on how organizations can prepare themselves for high performance in these situations. It examines how individuals and groups make decisions in crises, identifies the skills and management systems crises demand, considers the differences between managing routine emergencies and crises, and asks how organizations can effectively prepare for crises in advance.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|13601
MGMT E-5095 Disaster Relief and Recovery|Arnold M. Howitt|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/disaster-relief-recovery/23490|When disasters strike—whether natural disasters, failures of critical technology systems, disease, terrorism, or civil conflict—society must respond to the needs of individuals, families, and communities whose lives have been severely disrupted. Then in ensuing weeks, months, and years, an affected city or region must initiate recovery from the physical damage, social and economic disruption, and demoralization of a catastrophe. This course focuses on the management of humanitarian relief—shelter, food, medical care, and the restoration of critical public services and basic economic activity—once disaster rescues have been accomplished; and it looks at the dynamics of community recovery in the aftermath of major disasters. But these processes are not exclusively post-disaster; society must take steps in advance to be prepared to provide relief rapidly and make recovery as speedy and complete as possible. Through intensive study of cases of actual disasters and of conceptual frameworks about relief and recovery, the course looks at examples in the United States and in other countries and considers the provision and coordination of international aid in disaster settings.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|23490

MGMT E-5425 Design Thinking|Margaret C. Andrews|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/design-thinking/15139|Design thinking is a method of applying creativity to come up with novel solutions to tough problems. It's the process of immersing yourself in a problem space, thinking creatively around pain points and opportunity areas, then iteratively prototyping totally new solutions. Focused on listening, user empathy, whole-brain thinking, collaboration, and experimentation, design thinking can be applied within any team and in any field; from architecture and design to healthcare and product development. Everything from the Swiffer to the Apple Watch has been a result of design thinking, and the techniques and tools can also be applied to problems in the nonprofit and public sectors. This course delves into the fundamentals of this creative approach by immersing students in the doing of design thinking. Throughout the course, students learn how to empathize with the needs and motivations of the end users, come up with a large number of ideas for solving a problem, hone in on the right value proposition, and start to prototype a new offering.|Fall Term 2016|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|15139

Students explore common organizational situations involving apparent trade-offs between profit or productivity goals and more qualitative values such as loyalty, reciprocity, fairness, honesty, or altruism. The situations explored include those relevant to marketing and commerce (price gouging in a crisis, for example), firm collaborations (transparency in partnerships), negotiations (trust), international development (standards and responsibility), lay-offs/downsizing (impacts), environmental crises (prevention and recuperation), and the management of corporate culture (values and leadership).

MGMT E-5805 Real Estate Enterprise Management|Teo Nicolais|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/real-estate-enterprise-management/15129|Students engage in a series of in-depth, practical decision making situations in the field of real estate investment through Harvard Business School case studies. We review the methods by which real property investments are analyzed—including both financial and nonfinancial considerations. Students then step into the shoes of a first-time investor, meet the various players in the process, and weigh the risks and opportunities from the standpoint of an individual investor as well as a lender. Next, students gain experience in assessing investors' specific needs, creating financial feasibility analyses of several competing projects, and selecting the most appropriate investments. We examine operational aspects of real estate projects while grappling with coordinating a warehouse rehabilitation project, deciding how to set fair benchmark accountability standards for third-party contractors and how to align incentives—all while staying on schedule and on budget. Students gain experience in the time-honored real estate skills of diplomacy, consensus building, and good old-fashioned horse trading as they negotiate with a large tenant and, in another case study, pursue a development in an urban setting surrounded by myriad concerned (and active) community stakeholders. Students experience the real estate field from a small financial services company's viewpoint and address the perennial dilemma of whether to risk transitioning into a large institutionalized company or risk remaining a small entrepreneurial company indefinitely. Finally, students face down panic and uncertainty when the half-way completed New York City skyscraper they are responsible for building is threatened by a global financial crisis— and determine which considerations are most important and what risks are most relevant. Students should prepare for active engagement with the instructor and their peers in this fast-paced, case study driven course.|Fall Term 2016|Online only|15129

MGMT E-6610 Social Purpose Marketing|Kristian Merenda|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/social-purpose-marketing/24491|Globalization, increasing transparency in business operations, and the prevalence of social media have forever changed the way stakeholders view and interact with organizations. Societal and business imperatives are not only considered compatible, they can be increasingly viewed as one and the same. People today often communicate, organize, and engage based on mutual interests and generally place greater trust in organizations and individuals that work for a better world. Marketing has often been referred to as the science of sales. Whether you are selling a product, an intervention, or an idea, it can be a powerful tool for advancing social change in today's dynamic environment. The strategic integration of a relevant social purpose into a product, business, or nonprofit organization through brand-building citizenship activities can drive consumer and donor recall, consideration, acquisition, retention, and propensity to recommend. However, these efforts do not usually constitute a silver bullet and may not be the best solution to a business problem or societal need at all. In the worst cases, ill-conceived citizenship marketing strategies can result in damaging consequences. Practitioners must be pragmatic when engaging in marketing social change. Understanding how to apply best practices, identify opportunities, address challenges, engage stakeholders, and innovate strategically are essential skills in this rapidly evolving sector. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an in-depth understanding of how marketing principles can be applied to create both short-term and lasting social change. Students explore dimensions of the modern landscapes of brand, corporate and nonprofit citizenship, and how they relate to marketing. Areas of study include cause-related marketing and cause branding, nonprofit branding, and social movements, as well as corporate social responsibility and shared value creation.|Spring Term 2017|Live web conference w/ required on-campus weekend|24491

MGMT E-6750 Marketing Analytics: Fundamental Data-Driven Marketing|Christina Inge|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/marketing-analytics-fundamental-data-driven-marketing/24774|As big data moves into the mainstream, marketers are seeing the opportunity to make the profession more scientific and numbers-driven than ever before. In addition, with measurement at the center of every marketing campaign, marketers have the opportunity to prove the return on investment of their programs with unprecedented accuracy. Yet, this wealth of data can be overwhelming. Every channel has its own metrics, every demographic group's behavior can be mined for targeting information. What are the numbers that matter? And what are they really telling us? How can we best leverage big data and marketing analytics to optimize results? This course explores the growing role of data in marketing. Taking a two-fold approach, the course looks in-depth at the two primary kinds of data available to marketers: internal, or what is called marketing analytics, and external, or big data. Using real-world examples and practical exercises, the course allows students to understand the interactions between both kinds of data, and how best to use both to improve marketing outcomes, demonstrate return on investment to the C-suite, and create increasingly effective marketing campaigns.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24774

MUSE E-100 Introduction to Museum Studies|Katherine Burton Jones|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-museum-studies/10207|All museums share responsibility for preserving and interpreting our cultural and natural heritage for the benefit of the public and society. However, museums are more than the collections they house and the exhibits and programs they present. Each museum is a complex network of individuals whose common goal is to create knowledge and to share information and experiences with others. This course provides a broad introduction to the museum world. Students gain an understanding of the museum and the challenges and responsibilities that museums and their staff members encounter.  After discussing what a museum is, the various types of museums and their roles in the community, we introduce current and emerging issues in museums in a number of areas including governance, management of collections, fundraising, and museum jobs and responsibilities.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|10207

Monaghan|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/universal-design-accessibility-museums-public-spaces/24786|How do museums expand and enhance access to all audiences? This course examines the development and application of universal design in museums. Universal design involves creating products and spaces so that they can be used by the widest range of people possible. Universal design evolved from accessible design, a design process that addressed the needs of people with disabilities. Universal design takes into account the full range of human diversity, including physical, perceptual, and cognitive abilities, as well as different body sizes and shapes. By designing for this diversity, we can create spaces that are more functional and more user-friendly for everyone. The course explores current technologies used in universal design, assessments of physical and communication barriers of museum facilities, and cost-effective mediations and adaptations for museums.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24786

MUSE E-124 Smithsonian: Creative Engagement at the National Museum of Natural History|Rebecca Bray|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/smithsonian-creative-engagement-national-museum-natural-history/15097|Museums are changing. Many are experimenting with shifting old models of exhibit-based, one-way communication in favor of engagement strategies that involve participation and meaningful involvement of nontraditional audiences. The Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History has created a new physical space and initiative called Q?rius that has been experimenting with creative audience interaction. Opened in 2013, educators use the space to prototype, test, refine, and deploy many kinds of interactive activities and programs from games to collections-based labs and digital fieldbooks to experimental scientist programs. At the heart of the initiative is an active group of youth from local communities underrepresented in science who act as activity advisors and visitor facilitators in the space. In this course, the educators who created and run Q?rius lead students in activities that allow them to experience the process of developing a new kind of museum space like this. Before the weekend, the students read studies on community engagement and learning interaction design, along with front-end evaluation and other research that informed the creation of Q?rius. Upon arriving in Washington, DC, students explore the activities and programs of Q?rius and talk with its creators and managers about the impact, lessons learned, and potential. On Saturday, students take part in workshops based on the Q?Method, a creative design methodology used to make the interactive activities at the museum. The students engage in rapid prototyping and practice setting goals for collections-based inquiry learning. On the final day, students have the opportunity to engage with staff in collaborative design critique and a session to learn the art of facilitating museum experiences.|Fall Term 2016|Active learning weekend|15097

Organizations cannot learn and improve in any systematic way without some means of assessment. Museum professionals in nearly any position find themselves required to conduct evaluations for their institution or oversee contracted researchers. This course provides students with a general understanding of the entire research process from the development of initial guiding questions to the final reporting. The course is appropriate for emerging and experienced professionals interested in education, exhibitions, marketing, and development in museums and related organizations who may be involved in the design, oversight, implementation, or consumption of research and evaluation.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24789
MUSE E-129 Museum as Active Learning Space|Doris Sommer|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/museum-active-learning-space/24476|This course gives museum administrators and educators new tools for making museums agents of change in the world. Using the pre-texts model, an artist/educator training program that combines high-order literacy, innovation, and citizenship, the course encourages students to develop hands-on, art-making activities that turn museum collections into resources for exploring difficult texts. Art works are studied and used to create visual and performative interpretations of challenging written material that people would otherwise not access. In this way, museums play a central role in developing good readers and engaged viewers of art. Museum staff expand their role beyond traditional modes of providing outreach to engage their visitors with the texts through art and vice-versa, making for a deeper and more meaningful learning experience in the museum setting. In this active learning weekend, students hear lectures, make their own art, and experience the pre-texts that their museum visitors might use. They are challenged to step outside of the box to think creatively about how their museum or a museum might work with its community in new ways that develop an appreciation for art and citizenship.|Spring Term 2017|Active learning weekend|24476

MUSE E-133 Performing the Digital Museum|Susan Hazan|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/performing-digital-museum/15155|The museum experience is characterized by its penchant for authenticity and originality in a space that typically casts itself in the role of encapsulating science and culture for posterity. Digital artifacts, in contrast, signal endless cloneability and a built-in temporality, where the very intangibility of the digital object inevitably becomes a provocation to the museum ethos of materiality and stability. This course outlines the numerous ways that information technologies, in spite of their built-in temporality, are located in the museum's ecosystem and serve to augment, amplify, and disseminate the museum experience in numerous, propitious ways. This course serves to propel collections, exhibitions, and embedded knowledge into new spaces well beyond the museum wall; even directly into the palm of your hand.|Fall Term 2016|Online (live) web conference|15155

Hight|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/museum-architecture-modern-contemporary/15141|Art, history, and science museums all have the same basic goals: the preservation and exhibition of their collections. How are museum buildings designed to accommodate these goals? How have museums evolved from the transformation of the Louvre Palace into a public museum during the French Revolution, to the spectacular museum architecture found around the world today? Through a series of case studies of international museums, dating primarily from the past seventy-five years, we examine each museum's history, collections, and mission in relation to its architecture. Finally, we look at the process for developing an architectural feasibility study for the creation, renovation, or expansion of a museum.|Fall Term 2016|Online (live) web conference|15141
MUSE E-150 The Role of Museums in History|Mary Malloy|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/role-museums-history/14776|In the ancient world, a museum was a place where ideas were exchanged. Using that definition as a starting point, this course examines the intellectual life of museums beginning with concepts of collecting and cultural property in the medieval period. We look at how traders, pilgrims, and crusaders perceived objects they brought back to western Europe; how the organization of collections into taxonomic categories influenced science in the age of Enlightenment; how natural history, anthropology, and art museums contributed to the development of those subject fields; the gulf between the "learned societies" and the P. T. Barnums; how social changes in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to the rise of large public museums; and how museums are redefining themselves today as educational, social, and cultural institutions.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|14776

Greene|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/museums-questions-cultural-property-whats-loot-whats-not/24713|This course considers questions surrounding the role of museums in defining, displaying, and defending cultural property. For purposes of the course, cultural property is understood to include portable art objects and artifacts as well fixed monuments and sites. Through a series of case studies it examines in turn such issues as ownership, stewardship, and repatriation; looting, illicit trade, and the cultural property marketplace; and the protection of cultural property in the face both of armed conflict and peacetime economic development. It also explores the relationships between material cultural property and contemporary and historical human identities at the national, regional, and local scale, especially as these identities are portrayed in museums. Though not devoted in depth to matters of cultural property law or museum law, the course takes into account the wide range of national laws, international conventions, and treaties that pertain to cultural property. The course has a decided focus on the Mediterranean and Middle East, areas of the instructor's particular specialization, with excursions into relevant parallel cases in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24713
MUSE E-172 Museums, Public Programs, and Social Change|Monica Montgomery|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/museums-public-programs-social-change/15088|Museums have the potential to be centers of gravity inviting discourse and participation from audiences around current events and the pressing issues of our time. A new wave of community minded museums is taking up the charge, to shine a light on civic unrest, racial violence, human rights issues, and beyond. Provocative and timely public programs help museums, explore new narratives, foster civic engagement, and address social change movements, while building a base of dynamic new museum goers. As America's demographics continue to change ever more quickly, it is imperative for museums to evolve to meet the needs of increasingly diverse communities. This course explores various institutions as case studies and examines the public programs and initiatives they host, using technology, public forums, artistic demonstrations, activism, live performance, collections, and talk-backs to reframe personal histories, expand interpretations, and increase tolerance in society, as catalysts of social movements.|Fall Term 2016|Online (live) web conference|15088

MUSI E-194 Performing Musical Difference|Kay Kaufman Shelemay|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/performing-musical-difference/24714|Taught in cooperation with musicians of the Harvard-affiliated Silk Road Ensemble, this course explores the social processes and ethical challenges of intercultural musical exchange, composition, and performance. With an articulated humanistic goal of creating "unexpected connections, collaborations, and communities in pursuit of meaningful change," the Silk Road Project provides a rich laboratory for appraising how dimensions of difference have been conveyed through artistic performance as well as the many issues that such initiatives raise. Critical and reflexive theoretical approaches from ethnomusicology, anthropology, and performance studies, among other disciplines, are used to frame selected case studies relevant to the Silk Road Ensemble experience. Topics include the cultivation of cultural difference through the arts, the ethics of intercultural musical collaboration, the potential of social engagement to mitigate pressing social and political problems, and the role of the arts in community building. The course includes a mix of lecture, discussion of assigned readings and listening examples, and dialogue about issues with musicians from the Silk Road Ensemble who serve as interlocutors and provide insider perspectives of the ensemble's work. This course provides a rare opportunity for students to address important cultural issues in the performing arts while taking into account the perspectives of distinguished performers involved in this work. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Music 194r.|Spring Term 2017|Online only|24714
NUTR E-105 Food and Nutrition in Health and Wellbeing|Rachele Pojednic|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/food-nutrition-health-wellbeing/14784|Students examine evidence-based relationships between nutrition and the promotion of long-term health and wellbeing. They become familiar with food-related policy and recommendations, including the US Dietary Guidelines, FDA Food Labels, and evidence-based nutrition programs, and gain practical skills to make healthful dietary choices. Moreover, students learn health promotion strategies to help influence other people's food choices and apply these strategies to a specific modifiable chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. After successful completion of this course, students are able to identify the fundamentals of a healthy eating pattern; recognize associations between dietary behaviors and non-communicable diseases and identify evidence-based dietary interventions for those diseases; understand barriers to healthful eating, including cultural, environmental, and social; utilize validated tools to encourage healthful food choices; provide practical advice to improve dietary behaviors; and become adept at accessing evidence-based resources to maintain the most up-to-date knowledge, skills, and tools to promote good nutrition.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|14784
NUTR E-115 Food, Nutrition, and the Environment: The Science of Why What We Eat Matters|P. K. Newby|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/food-nutrition-environment-science-why-what-we-eat-matters/15144|Whoever you are, wherever you live, one question we all ask is the same: What should I eat for dinner? In public health, we also ask: Why does it matter for human populations, and our planet? Our daily diet has significant personal, local, and global consequences, farm to fork. Yet junk-science is rampant, making it difficult for people to know what to eat for optimal health and wellness for their bodies, as well as our shared environment. The goal of this course is to examine what and how we eat, and why it matters. The course is taught using a four-quadrant nutritional ecology framework that comprises environment, economy, society, and health. The course covers topics ranging from understanding different production systems, ancient and modern, to identifying critical problems related to how we grow and consume food, chronic disease to climate change. We also examine different paradigms and approaches for generating healthy and sustainable solutions. Throughout the course, students are exposed to cutting-edge research and influential thought-leaders informing today's food conversations both in theory and in practice. Lectures, readings, activities, and online discussions are designed to challenge students to examine their belief systems about what they eat, and to think critically about their own choices in light of public health and sustainable development. Assignments allow students to analyze thoroughly their own diet and consider how their shopping and eating behaviors impact their individual health and society as a whole. At the course's conclusion, students have developed a solid scientific foundation for understanding why what we eat matters, farm to fork—and have acquired the tools and skills to make the healthiest and most sustainable food choices, people to planet. Students who have completed ENVR E-129 in the past cannot receive degree credit for NUTR E-115.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|15144

PHIL E-102 Power and Responsibility: Doing Philosophy with Superheroes|Christopher Robichaud|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/power-responsibility-doing-philosophy-superheroes/24689|Pow! Bang! Kaboom! Superhero stories, first arriving on the scene in the late 1930s, are now among the most popular forms of global entertainment. From Superman's embrace of truth, justice, and the American way to Wonder Woman's efforts at promoting peace rather than war, from Spider-Man's personal struggles at balancing his romantic life with his crime fighting exploits to the X-Men's social struggles with combating prejudice and antagonism, the world has turned its attention to these colorful and larger-than-life narratives, which first emerged in comic books and radio shows but now are also widely found in film, television, and video games. This course leverages the enthusiasm over superheroes to introduce students to core areas of philosophy—metaphysics and epistemology, social and political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of mind, and more. By directly engaging these fantastic narratives, it demonstrates that behind the four-colored panels are stories and characters of depth and complexity, affording us many opportunities to learn important and substantive philosophical ideas in a fresh and exciting way.|Spring Term 2017|Online only|24689

PHIL E-160 Philosophical Foundations for Economic Justice|Joanne Baldine|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/philosophical-foundations-economic-justice/14859|This course examines philosophical foundations of three fundamentally different economic systems—capitalism, socialism/egalitarianism, and the welfare state. Through the selection of readings we think critically about the prospects for economic justice introduced by each system. The main questions focus on what features an economic system and a society ought to have in order to be economically just, and what sorts of claims the different classical economic systems advance in the name of economic justice. In addition, we critically examine opportunities for and obstacles to economic justice in the current global economy—under conditions that did not exist for any of the three classical economic systems. At all times we consider responsibilities of fairness, moral culpability, the requirements of a good life, the grounding of claims for a good life, the problem of poverty, and the ways in which economic systems materially and culturally set conditions for a productive, fair, and just life for all members of the global community.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|14859
PHIL E-162 Economic Justice|Mathias Risse|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/economic-justice/24560|Capitalism organizes society around individual pursuits of material gain. Capitalism seems to have won the great ideological struggle with other ways of organizing society. But there is much discontent. The Occupy Movement made clear that even Americans now care about excessive inequality, and many worry about the future in an increasingly economically divided society where access to technology richly rewards some to the exclusion of many others. Capitalism is also closely associated with what is arguably the biggest policy problem of the twenty-first century, climate change. So how can we justify capitalism? And what are feasible alternative ways of organizing society? This class begins with an assessment of the current crisis and explores a range of influential arguments for capitalism. Then we turn to socialist/communist approaches focusing on some of the more influential writings of Karl Marx. Finally, we explore the liberal egalitarianism of John Rawls. The debate about capitalism and its alternatives (and about what capitalism might learn from those) addresses the central political and social concerns of our times. This class offers an in-depth encounter with the major positions in that debate and thereby prepares students to participate in that debate in an informed way. While the first three lectures explore the current predicament and focus on social-scientific readings, the methodological outlook of the class is philosophical. Nonetheless, our concern is always with questions that shape political agendas now and in the foreseeable future. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Ethical Reasoning 41.|Spring Term 2017|Online only|24560

PHIL E-169 From Sinners to Sociopaths: The Many Faces of Evil|Amelie Rorty|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/sinners-sociopaths-many-faces-evil/24563|Why is there so much fuss about morality? We explore the lure of evil from Biblical abominations, to Christian sin, Greek vice, medieval malevolence, and Enlightenment failures of rationality, ending with socially constructed crime and socio-pathology. Each student traces the history of his or her favorite form of evil (greed, lust, malice). We stage debates about the proper locus of moral condemnation, as focused on behavior, or on character and willfulness, or on socially maladaptive behavior. We read juicy selections from theology (Augustine and Calvin), philosophy (Kant, Nietzsche, Arendt), literary works (Milton, Baudelaire, Dostoyevsky), and psychology (Freud). We visit the Fogg to discuss some artworks (Gothic images of the vices, Hogarth, Goya, Grosz) and view some films (M, The Third Man).|Spring Term 2017|On campus only|24563

PSYC E-1440 Sleep and Mental Health|Edward Franz Pace-Schott|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/sleep-mental-health/14644|The scientific study of sleep is an area of research that is both highly diverse and among the most interdisciplinary and unifying of topics in psychology and neuroscience. In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives. Importantly, sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. Following an overview on the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep, students choose a topic related to the effects of sleep on mental health to research in depth, to present to the class, and to discuss in a term paper. Topics might include the characteristic abnormalities in sleep occurring in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive, autism spectrum, or neurodegenerative disorders. Such changes are increasingly seen as bidirectional, with sleep disturbances contributing to the waking symptoms of these mental disorders. Other topics might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness such as the linkage between sleep apnea and depression, circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness, insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders, or contribution of nocturnal seizures to neurodevelopmental disorders. Still other topics may focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and human performance factors. For those with more neuroscientific interests, topics might include neuroimaging of cognitive functioning following sleep deprivation or the growing interest in trafficking and disposal of abnormal proteins during sleep having a potential role in neurodegenerative illness. The course includes an optional field trip to a clinical sleep laboratory.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|14644
PSYC E-1501 Industrial-Organizational Psychology|Jack Demick|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/industrial-organizational-psychology/24817|Traditionally, industrial psychology and organizational psychology have been distinguished from one another on the basis of respective content areas. Industrial psychology (often called personnel psychology) is the scientific study of the efficient management of an industrial labor force and particularly the difficulties encountered by workers in a mechanized environment. Industrial psychology typically encompasses areas of inquiry such as worker recruitment, selection, classification, compensation, performance appraisals, and training. Organizational psychology is the scientific study of individual and group behavior in formal organizational settings. A major assumption is that the essence of an organization is patterned human behavior. When behavior is patterned, some structure is imposed on individuals. This structure characteristically comes in the form of roles (normative standards governing behavior) and a guiding set of values; an organization cannot exist when people just do their own thing without any awareness of the behavior of others. Organizational psychology characteristically involves the study of socialization, motivation, occupational stress, leadership, group performance, and organizational development.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24817
PSYC E-1503 The Psychology of Close Relationships|Holly Parker|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/psychology-close-relationships/14319|This course is an exploration of the psychology of close human relationships. Although we are primarily learning about intimate (romantic) relationships, we also discuss friendships, as well as the places where these two kinds of relationships intersect, and the ways in which they interact. Other kinds of close relationships (family and work relationships, for example) are integrated into the course, and although they are extremely valuable relationships in their own right, they are addressed secondarily to romantic relationships and friendships for the purposes of this course. Examples of topics include the biological bases of attraction and love, relationship formation and dissolution, relational interaction patterns, relationship satisfaction, and the social context of relationships (the influence of others). Students have an opportunity to explore relationships through readings in the popular press, but ultimately a scholarly, critical examination of the scientific literature serves as the foundation of our learning throughout the course. Students find that the literature contains unexpected findings that can change the way they look at relationships, both from academic and applied, real-life perspectives.|Fall Term 2016|On campus with online option|14319
PSYC E-1504 The Science and Application of Positive Psychology|Stephanie Peabody|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/science-application-positive-psychology/24824|Positive Psychology researchers define happy people as those who are satisfied with life and who have more positive moods than negative ones. The research demonstrates that there are some key factors that shape well-being. Genetics comprise about half of the influence on people's dispositions and about 10 percent of happiness comes from circumstances. This leaves a significant percentage of what determines happiness to our control, our chosen activities, our lifestyle behaviors. People who can choose what they do, and who choose wisely, influence about 40 percent of their own well-being.  Scientific research has now revealed the things that actually bring sustained happiness and a life of well-being. Going through the change process essential to flourish in life is within a person's control, if s/he is ready, informed with evidence, and willing to take the appropriate action(s) and make the necessary commitment. This course is designed to explore the concepts (biological, psychological, social, and emotional), research behind the concepts, techniques, and exercises that enhance well-being. In addition, students have the opportunity to engage in a detailed analysis and evidence-based positivity change process using self-assessment measures and concrete positive psychology and well-being enhancing activities.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24824
PSYC E-1507 Psychology of Diversity|Mona S. Weissmark|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/psychology-diversity/24068|The United States is becoming increasingly diverse and the world increasingly globalized. The central focus of the course is on the links between diversity and psychological processes at individual, interpersonal, and international levels. We consider several basic questions, including: What is diversity? How do race, nationality, and religion influence individuals? What impact does diversity have on cross-group relationships? How is diversity related to people's perceptions of fairness and justice? What is the relevance of people's perceptions of fairness and justice to social problems and social change? Does respect for diversity promote peace and positive change? Much research has addressed these questions, and we closely examine the evidence that has emerged so far.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24068
PSYC E-1603 Adolescent and Young Adult Development|Dante Spetter|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/adolescent-young-adult-development/24716|Adolescence and early adulthood are unique periods in social, emotional, spiritual, and cognitive development. Youth must first incorporate new ways of thinking and feeling into their emerging self concepts, and later establish an identity apart from their family of origin. Whereas in prior generations choosing a career was often considered the sine qua non of identity development (at least for young men), most young adults expect to change both jobs and careers several times. Similarly, forming intimate partnerships followed a far more predictable template, at least for the majority of young people, but today's youth more consciously consider a wide array of relationships. This course focuses on both the traditional perspectives on cognitive, social, and emotional development and on the challenges of negotiating these universal developmental tasks in the modern world.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24716

PSYC E-1611 Mind, Body, Medicine, and Health|Sayyed Mohsen Fatemi|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/mind-body-medicine-health/14597|The mind/body interaction has important implications for the way we view illness and treat disease. This course provides knowledge and skills for health and wellness coaches and related professionals to effectively examine and apply mind/body medicine. In this course students learn how to facilitate, in themselves and others, the goal of self-care, a complement to the conventional medical paths of surgery and pharmaceuticals. They consider the bio-genomic-neural basis for both illness and related effective treatments. Physical health is influenced by thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and conversely, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can be influenced by physical symptoms. Social factors are important as well. Mind/body medicine recognizes resiliency as a public health initiative and promotes resiliency practices through lifestyle behaviors for disease prevention and treatment. Students learn how they and their clients can take control of their lives, as well as ways to use their own healing power to reduce stress and other negative behaviors and thoughts in order to maintain or regain health. Students also develop awareness and skills in a variety of mind/body practices including environmental strategies that influence health and resiliency and meditation methods that elicit the relaxation response. In addition, students practice successful methodology to enhance mind/body practices in various patient populations, in particular, those who are socio-economically compromised.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|14597

Students learn a method for recognizing and analyzing how religious ideologies are embedded in all arenas of human agency and not isolated from political, economic, and cultural life as is often assumed. In addition to examining the conflicts themselves, we also explore the religious dimensions of the impacts those conflicts have on civic life in areas such as public health, education, and commerce. What roles do religions play in fostering violence and what roles do they play in promoting peace? How do religious institutions and ideologies function to support and/or thwart public health initiatives? What are the ideological justifications for functional economic policies and how do they reflect and/or challenge diverse religious values? What roles do religions play in advancing or suppressing educational opportunities and for whom? Are media representations of the religious dimensions of conflict accurate? Possible countries of focus include Brazil, Egypt, France, Israel/Palestine, Myanmar, Nigeria, Qatar, the Philippines, Somalia, Syria, Turkey, and the United States.

How can we help poor and marginalized children get a decent education, and how will that matter to their future life prospects and to the development of the societies in which they live? This course examines key contemporary educational global challenges, focusing on options to effect systemic change in public education systems in developing nations. We discuss current global efforts to provide quality education. We examine the role of international agencies and governments in advancing policy reform, and study various approaches to generating and analyzing policy alternatives.|Fall Term 2016|Online only|13802
SSCI E-112 The Idea of the Internet|David Weinberger|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/idea-internet/24831-0|The debate about the Internet's effect on institutions and behavior rages on. Less discussed is the way the net may be transforming some of the West's most fundamental ideas about who we are, how the world works, and what we can do together. We argue about whether Facebook is making us more or less narcissistic, but we should also be asking whether it's changing our ideas about friendship and what it means to be social. We worry that Google is making us "stoopid" (as a cover story in The Atlantic put it) but we should also be wondering if it's changing our ideas about what it means to be smart. We are told over and over that the net is creating echo chambers in which people only hear opinions that agree with their own, but we don't ask about the assumptions about how conversation works that underly our fears. In this course, we consider the Internet's effect on ideas that we've long taken for granted, by together examining its effect on our institutions and behavior.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24831
SSCI E-115 Class and Culture|James P. Herron|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/class-culture/14830|It is commonplace to note that in the United States a large portion of the population self-identifies as middle class, even though our society is marked by deep, persistent, and increasing class inequality. Such self-identification, however, can obscure the complex and often contradictory ways in which we experience social class in our everyday lives. This course explores the cultural dimensions of social class in the US from an ethnographic perspective, focusing on the everyday lives and cultures of ordinary Americans. We consider questions such as the following: what is it like to be a working class person in a society heavily invested in ideas of individual advancement and meritocracy? How do professionals (the upper middle class) define themselves and how do they view those above and below them in the class structure? How does social class shape people's values, political views, and tastes? How are class boundaries created and maintained? The course readings are drawn mainly from anthropology and sociology.|Fall Term 2016|On campus only|14830
SSCI E-124 Global Health Challenges: Complexities of Evidence-Based Policy|Sue J. Goldie|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/global-health-challenges-complexities-evidence-based-policy/24819|This course provides a broad conceptual foundation for critically thinking about population health in a global context, positioning health as a social objective that contributes to human development, human rights, and global security. We explore health conditions (for example, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and maternal-child mortality, non-communicable diseases, intentional and unintentional injuries); health determinants (social, political, and environmental conditions that influence health) operating within and beyond borders; and societal responses to health challenges (health systems, public policy, social entrepreneurship, and global governance). Health indicators, population metrics, and graphics are used to analyze the magnitude, distribution, and trends of disease patterns and population dynamics across and within countries, with particular attention to the contemporary challenges of widening inequities, forced migration, displaced populations, and rapid urbanization. Using historical and contemporary examples, we consider how knowledge is contextualized and translated to policy and action. The recorded lectures are from the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences course Societies of the World 24.|Spring Term 2017|Online only|24819
SSCI E-126 AIDS, Earthquakes, and Ebola: The Fight to Save the World|Jason Bryan Silverstein|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/aids-earthquakes-ebola-fight-save-world/24803|This course is an introduction to global health through three dramatic case studies. First, we turn back the clock to the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s and investigate what it took to deliver drugs and save lives. By doing so, we develop a diverse toolkit that introduces students to approaches from history, anthropology, public health, law, and medicine. The goal is to understand illness as both something that happens in the body and something that happens in society. With these approaches in our toolbox, we turn our attention to the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the subsequent cholera epidemic. We ask hard questions about the unintended consequences of good intentions and consider the challenges of providing care in the poorest parts of the world. Finally, we turn to the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which the World Health Organization called "the most severe acute public health emergency seen in modern times." We read about the response from Partners in Health and Last Mile Health and see what happened when modern medicine met this deadly illness—only to ask why it never had before. For premedical students, this course reviews concepts found on the psychological, social, and biological foundations of behavior section of the MCAT, including how sociocultural factors and access to resources have an impact on health.|Spring Term 2017|On campus with online option|24803
SSCI E-127 Cultural Evolution|Joseph Henrich|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/cultural-evolution/14825|Unlike other species, humans are heavily reliant on learning from others to acquire many important aspects of their behavior, and this cultural transmission has created a second system of inheritance that has driven much of our species genetic evolution. In addition to having shaped our species' anatomy and physiology, cultural evolution has important implications for understanding human nature, and for how to tackle basic problems in psychology, economics, and anthropology. The first third of this course develops the basic principles and lines of empirical inquiry while the remainder applies, hones, and refines them by exploring economic development, the history of modern institutions, and global inequality.

SSCI E-400A Crafting the Thesis Proposal for Psychology and Clinical Psychology|Evan Kleiman|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/crafting-thesis-proposal-psychology-clinical-psychology/24840|This course is designed to refine students' research skills and critical thinking ability while they work to develop their own specific research proposal for the required ALM thesis in the fields of psychology or clinical psychology. The goal of the course is to produce a strong thesis proposal draft in community with fellow degree candidates. Upon successful completion of the course, you then submit your working draft to the behavioral sciences research advisor for further one-on-one development and the official matching of your topic with a thesis director.  Class meetings are geared toward providing students with both the practical research skills (for example, use of library resources, proposal structure, and advanced writing skills) and scientific literacy skills (scientific approaches and controversies in the scientific literature) necessary to successfully draft a thesis proposal in the area of psychology or clinical psychology. There is a heavy emphasis on creating a connection with your classmates in order to create a supportive community of scholars that may continue to meet after the course is over. The crafting of a thesis proposal and a thesis project does not need to be done in isolation. Supportive writing groups are common in all research fields, enabling students to rely on knowledgeable peers to read and critique their work, particularly with respect to clarity, tone, and the use of evidence.|Spring Term 2017|Online (live) web conference|24840

STAR E-176 Nazi Cinema: The Art of Propaganda|Eric Rentschler|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/nazi-cinema-art-propaganda/13396|When we think about the Third Reich, we cannot help but think of the violence and devastation inflicted upon millions by Adolf Hitler and the German people. We also recall well-known images of fanatic believers hallowing their charismatic leader in monumental demonstrations of self-surrender. To this day, Nazi Germany abides in collective memories as a site of mass murder and mass manipulation. This course focuses, however, on a third element that most of us do not so immediately associate with National Socialism, namely mass culture and its key role in history's first media dictatorship. We analyze seminal films of the Third Reich as popular commodities, ideological constructs, aesthetic artifacts, and historical entities. In so doing we seek to comprehend how the fantasy ware of the Hitler era functioned within the larger contexts of state terror, world war, and genocide. We are also concerned with the enduring afterlife of Nazi sights and sounds, especially their presence in contemporary popular culture.

STAR E-182 American Dreams from Scarface to Easy Rider|Eric Rentschler|http://extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/american-dreams-scarface-easy-rider/23949|This class familiarizes students with popular films produced during crucial junctures in the modern history of the United States, from the Great Depression and World War II through the Cold War, the McCarthy era, and the 1960s. More specifically, we study how Hollywood's dream factory responded to dramatic challenges that states of crisis and emergency posed to the founding ideals of our democracy. We look at the wide range of functions that commercial fantasy productions assumed, how they at times legitimated and bolstered the status quo, but at others also interrogated, exposed, and even indicted social inequity. Films provide a representative sampling of classical American features from 1932 to 1969, including Scarface, King Kong, The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, High Noon, The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Manchurian Candidate, and Easy Rider.
