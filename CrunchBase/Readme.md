## CrunchBase Exploration

• Joined, aggregated and cleaned data from different tables provided by the platform CrunchBase by using MySql and Spark. 
• Rescaled data by log transformation to generate better visualizations like histograms of funds of innovative companies.
• Explored the relationships between funds and industries, regions, and people in management levels, and found that funding had more relationships with industries than other influencing factors like regions and people in management levels.
